His music defied expectation, finding form in disorder and harmony in dissonance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same spirit drives WordPress 6.8.

WordPress 6.8 brings a luster and gloss that only a polish release can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 Beta 1 contains over 370 enhancements and 520 bug fixes for the editor, including design improvements, polishing the query loop, and more than <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=6.8&amp;group=component&amp;max=500&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;order=priority\">230 tickets for WordPress 6.8 Core</a>. Here’s a glimpse of what’s coming:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Editor improvements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Easier ways to see your options in Data Views, and you can opt to ignore sticky posts in the Query Loop. Plus you’ll find lots of little improvements in the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Style Book comes to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Style Book now features a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/68036\">structured layout</a> so you can preview site colors, typography, and block styles more easily. You can use the Style Book in classic themes with editor-styles or a theme.json file and includes clearer labels, and you can find them under <code>Appearance &gt; Design</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Support for Speculation browser API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 introduces native support for speculative loading, leveraging the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to improve site performance with near-instant page loads. This feature prefetches or prerenders URLs based on user interactions, such as hovering over links, reducing load times for subsequent pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress 6.8 applies a conservative prefetching strategy, balancing performance gains with resource efficiency. Developers can customize speculative loading behavior using new filters, since the API does not include UI-based controls. The existing <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading feature plugin</a> will adapt to the core implementation, allowing deeper customization.&nbsp; Please test this feature in supported browsers (currently Chrome 108+ and Edge 108+, with more browsers evaluating) and provide feedback on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/62503\">#62503</a> to help refine its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Major security boost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.8 will use bcrypt for password hashing, which <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/02/17/wordpress-6-8-will-use-bcrypt-for-password-hashing/\">significantly hardens WordPress.</a> Other hashing is getting hardened, too, throughout the security apparatus. You won’t have to change anything in your daily workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The features included in this first beta may change before the final release of WordPress 6.8, based on what testers like you find.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-8/\">6.8 release cycle</a> and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-8/\"> 6.8-related posts</a> in the next few weeks for further details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Caveat on testing 6.8 Beta 1 in versions older than 5.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to an update made to the upgrade routine during this release, (see <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/59803\">r59803</a>), any upgrade from versions older than 5.1 will fail. Folks are working to resolve this specific issue, so please hold off on reporting on this while testing the Beta 1 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vulnerability bounty doubles during Beta &amp; Release Candidate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community sponsors a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/#enhanced-bounty-rewards-during-beta-and-release-candidate-phases\">monetary reward for reporting new, unreleased security vulnerabilities</a>. This reward doubles during the period between Beta 1 on March 4, 2025 and the final Release Candidate (RC) scheduled for April 15, 2025.  Please follow responsible disclosure practices as detailed in the project’s security practices and policies. You can find those on the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just for you: a Beta 1 haiku</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>March winds shift the tide.<br>Hands unite in open source;<br>WordPress moves ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>Props to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>audrasjb</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/mamaduka/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>mamaduka</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/michelleames/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>michelleames</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/bph/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>bph</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/jorbin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>jorbin</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/joemcgill/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>joemcgill</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>krupajnanda</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>desrosj</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/benjamin_zekavica/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>benjamin_zekavica</a> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lysyjan87/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lysyjan87</a></em> <em>for reviewing and collaborating on this post!</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"18582\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:12:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 02 May 2025 08:05:03 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:4:\"vary\";s:37:\"Accept-Encoding, accept, content-type\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:12:\"max-age=3600\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:17:09 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";i:1745555744;s:21:\"cache_expiration_time\";i:1746216302;s:23:\"__cache_expiration_time\";i:1746216302;}', 'off');

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, podcasting and finding inspiration in WordPress stories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Bud Kraus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud&#8217;s name might ring a bell in the WordPress community, not only for his teaching and writing, but also as the host of the Seriously, BUD? Podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud&#8217;s WordPress journey started back in 2009 when a client told him he had to learn WordPress, and ever since he&#8217;s been immersed in all aspects of it. From building sites to teaching, to creating content for major WordPress businesses. These days, Bud calls himself a WordPress content creative, focusing mainly on producing articles, videos, and of course, his own podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we turn the microphone around on Bud to talk about his transition from site building to content creation. He shares how the Seriously BUD? podcast came out of a desire to have real, unscripted conversations with people from around the WordPress community. Chats that go beyond plugins and code and dig into the stories, quirks and lives of the people behind the tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the format of the show, Bud&#8217;s technique for bringing out interesting stories, and the importance of really listening to guests. Bud explains his approach to podcast technology, why he thinks the tech stack doesn&#8217;t have to be intimidating or expensive, and he also offers insights into the editing process that makes his interviews come alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Bud shares his thoughts on the future of podcasting. Why it&#8217;s still such an appealing medium, and what it takes to keep a show fresh and enjoyable for the long haul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about podcasting, interested in the art of conversation, or are thinking about starting your own show, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Bud Kraus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Bud Kraus. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:12] Bud Kraus: Hi, Nathan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, very good. Nice to chat with you. The tables are turned because not that many weeks ago I appeared on your podcast, which is going to be the focus of this podcast today. So it&#8217;s kind of inception, WordPress Podcast inception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:27] Bud Kraus: You know, podcasting is getting very incestuous. I mean, everybody&#8217;s on everybody&#8217;s show. It&#8217;s more convoluted than the Hapsburg Empire. I mean, it really is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:36] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s a description. I like it. Before we begin and start to explore your podcast, why you did it and so on, let&#8217;s just get into who you are. So a couple of minutes, really, your potted bio. Tell us anything that you like. This is obviously a WordPress podcast, so centering it around your WordPress journey would probably be ideal. So, couple of minutes, over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] Bud Kraus: Alright. Well, I have a little elevator speech on this, or a little longer than an elevator. But in 2009 I had a friend client who sat me down at the Oyster Bar in New York City and said, you know, you really need to learn WordPress. And I said, no, I&#8217;m a Rage Against the Machine kind of guy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then he got very serious and then I started to learn. And once I learned that you could make a child theme and what that was all about, you know, I was hooked. And then I started teaching WordPress at FIT in New York City and everywhere. I was just teaching like crazy. And I was making websites, and eventually I got to hate making websites because I just wanted to do it my way, not the client&#8217;s way. That&#8217;s not really a good attitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And eventually in the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve really gotten into creating WordPress content for WordPress businesses. So I call myself a WordPress content creative. That also includes, of course, podcasting and my show Seriously, BUD? So that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:44] Nathan Wrigley: So are you still working with WordPress in any way, shape, or form for other people, or is it primarily just for yourself now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] Bud Kraus: I try not to, unless you beg me. Now, occasionally, no, I do have a couple of sites that I do updates for. I could get rid of that business. It&#8217;s not really much, but I just like doing it and I like the people and so, you know, I do it. But I have my own two sites, joyofwp.com and seriouslybud.com. And I am the client, so I get to decide everything and that&#8217;s what I like about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I don&#8217;t want to stop doing WordPress, okay, the site stuff, because it will diminish my ability to write and create WordPress content, but I don&#8217;t want to get paid to do it for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] Nathan Wrigley: And was the intuition to move into content, was that purposeful? In other words, did you sit yourself down and say, do you know what? I&#8217;m fed up of doing the client thing, I want to stay in the WordPress space, so what can I do? Well, content seems like a good thing. Or was it more an evolution where you just wrote a few pieces and discovered that you enjoyed that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:44] Bud Kraus: Well, I am not that smart. The first way to do it, like to think logically I should be doing this, I don&#8217;t go that way. So, Vikas Singhal from in InstaWP got me really on this track a couple years ago when we first met online. And he said, why don&#8217;t you create a video for me on security? I said, okay. And I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I started doing some other things, and then Marcus Burnette said, why don&#8217;t you write articles for GoDaddy? And I started doing that. And I said, you know, I have written articles before, but I never got paid for it. And I thought like, you actually can get paid to create WordPress content. No way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that turned into, now I write for Hostinger on a regular basis. I write for Kinsta on a regular basis. And I could write for, name it, okay. But that&#8217;s not, the problem is I can only, you know, one person and I&#8217;m not interested in cloning myself and making myself into a content agency. And so this is it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the podcast, well, we&#8217;ll get into that. But I wish I were smart enough to plan. Life is what happens to you while you&#8217;re busy making other plans. That&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:48] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I think the same is true for me. I was building client websites and straight into, I mean, all I do basically is create podcasts. I&#8217;ve never written much. I don&#8217;t really have the capacity to overcome the blank page at the beginning. But I stumbled into podcasting and it slowly became what I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was never an intention there. It surprised me that the WordPress ecosystem is actually big enough that that kind of thing is possible. Now, if everybody in the WordPress space decided to make a podcast, both you and I would be sunk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:22] Bud Kraus: Wait a minute. Pardon for the interruption, but doesn&#8217;t everybody in the WordPress space have a podcast. Where are you going with this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it does definitely sometimes feel that way. But if everybody did it, then we&#8217;d all be sunk. But the fact of the matter is, there are literally millions of people out there using WordPress. And so there&#8217;s a niche within a niche. You know, you can find, I don&#8217;t know, maybe you do a security podcast in the WordPress space or a community podcast or what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve settled on, Seriously, BUD? Tell us what that is then, and how you&#8217;ve settled on that format? And what is the format?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:55] Bud Kraus: Well, the idea came in an instant. This was after years of saying to Bob Dunn, you know, I will never make a podcast. What are you doing podcasts for? This is the most ridiculous thing. Why does anybody ever make a podcast? So I was not looking to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was in an Uber leaving WordCamp US 2023 in Washington. I&#8217;m telling you, like a lightning bolt, this thing hit my head and it went like this. You know, I wish I could spend more time with Nathan Wrigley. I just got to wave at him and like say hi, and that was about it. But boy, I&#8217;d certainly like to know about his childhood, his life, whatever, I&#8217;d like to spend more time, and have a conversation about his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in that instant, the show was born. Now, it wasn&#8217;t called Seriously, BUD? Right away it was called In Conversation With, but that&#8217;s such a boring subject title. But I knew right from the get go that this is what I wanted to do. And I also said, I don&#8217;t care if I ever get sponsors. Now I do. I don&#8217;t care if I ever get listeners. Now I do. But I just wanted to do it for myself because, you know, it was like, what do they say, scratch an itch or whatever it is. Itch a scratch or scratch an itch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was it. And about four or five months later, I did my first episode with Marcus. And it&#8217;s been every Friday at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning, in Eastern Standard time, a new episode comes out and I&#8217;ve, I don&#8217;t miss. The really cool thing is that the stories are phenomenal. I mean, there is a certain, similarities between people, there definitely is and I can write a book now about the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m also, you know, the purpose of the show too is not just to satisfy me, but to give people an opportunity to tell their stories. And not surprisingly, people like to talk about themselves. You know, so my job is sort of, let them do that, get out of the way, hopefully get them to say something that they don&#8217;t really want to say. It&#8217;s just been really, it&#8217;s taken over my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:47] Nathan Wrigley: Have you always been, how to describe it, a raconteur? Have you always been the kind of character that can fill a silence? Or is this something that you&#8217;ve had to develop and get out of your comfort zone a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:59] Bud Kraus: No. I&#8217;ve always been pretty good at talking to people. And I really started to realise that, or sort of got into that, I took this train trip around the United States in 2018. I was gone for 19 days, went all the way around the country, and I basically would interview people. Now, you know, I didn&#8217;t record much, but I would just go around and say, when you&#8217;re on a train for that long a period of time, you get to talk to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I started realising, my God, everybody I&#8217;m talking to has the most unbelievable story. It wasn&#8217;t like right from there, I went from that to WordPress, to my podcast. But I, you know, in a very gradual process, I started to realise that I like doing this. And the other thing is I love radio and the spoken word, and I think you do too. Most people who are in podcasting are sort of like frustrated radio personalities or whatever. I don&#8217;t feel that&#8217;s what I am, but I&#8217;ve always listened to talk radio ever since I was a little kid so, yeah, it all fits together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:56] Nathan Wrigley: I feel there is a certain skill if you are going to do interviews as you do, and it, I guess it&#8217;s more of a conversation what you have. I think most of content that I create is more of an interview where the person comes and I ask a series of questions, which hopefully elicit responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think there is a certain character trait about that. You know, the ability to ask questions and then sit back and listen. And that is one of the things that I discovered at the beginning was the most important skill is not necessarily the question, it&#8217;s the listening. Which sounds a bit the wrong way round. But if you&#8217;re not listening to each reply as it comes out the guest&#8217;s mouth, then the follow-up question is basically, you&#8217;re just following a proforma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, I&#8217;m going to ask this question, and then whatever comes out of their mouth when they finish saying that, I&#8217;ll go to this question. And that, for me, has never really worked. It&#8217;s been more a case of, okay, be quiet Nathan, listen to the reply, and then hopefully the conversation will flow, because a question that you didn&#8217;t anticipate will come out of your mouth. And so I wondered if that was a part that you&#8217;ve discovered as well as I did, that listening is equally important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:03] Bud Kraus: It&#8217;s probably more important now. You know, it reminds me, in fourth grade, I had a music teacher that said, it&#8217;s not the note you&#8217;re playing, it&#8217;s the next note. And that&#8217;s very much like what you&#8217;re talking about, which is you&#8217;re listening and you&#8217;re figuring out, and it&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s not that simple, because you&#8217;re listening to what they&#8217;re saying, but you&#8217;re also thinking, what&#8217;s going to be my follow up question? What&#8217;s the natural flow of the conversation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, and if you&#8217;re really good at it, you&#8217;re not really thinking that way. It just flows natural, you know? So if they say something, I think the first thing you need is curiosity. Where did that come from? Or, why did you do that? Or, how come you didn&#8217;t do this? And in fact, we&#8217;re releasing a book, an ebook now called Questions I Wish I Had Asked. And I have five people who have answered each one, their own question that I should have asked them, or I forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to this kind of stuff, you can build like a little empire with eBooks and blogs and this, you know, it&#8217;s just amazing what can grow out of a podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:55] Nathan Wrigley: I make sure that all of the guests have access to some sort of shared show notes, so that if I have a series of questions, at least they can be prepared. But also my weapon of choice is what you can now see, but the people listening to this can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s basically a pen and a piece of paper. When something during the course of our conversation occurs to me, I know that my job is to not interrupt you with that moment&#8217;s thought, but I just scribble it down and then when you&#8217;ve finished, see if that&#8217;s where the journey takes me. But it might be that something else comes along. So yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;re both very lucky though, in that we are in the technology space, and WordPress in particular is this perfect medium for getting a podcast out into the real world. Because I feel that for a lot of people, that&#8217;s another hurdle that they&#8217;ve got to go through. Okay, I want to make a podcast. How do I do that? Where do I put it? How do I get a website, and all of that? And so, what do you feel about that? Do you feel that you&#8217;re in a, you know, a lucky position that you knew WordPress when you started out this whole thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:55] Bud Kraus: Yeah, but I didn&#8217;t really launch with a website. I launched just by learning the software, Descript and SquadCast and the Riverside and this and that, you know? Because I didn&#8217;t know any of this. And, you know, some people were giving me, why don&#8217;t you check this, check that? And eventually I came up with my podcast stack. How do you like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then after I had a couple episodes out, I thought like, you know, I should have a website. And then that came along. And of course that&#8217;s easy because, you know, we both know WordPress, so that part&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re right. I mean, we&#8217;re lucky also that we&#8217;re in a community who is technologically savvy and will listen to podcasts. And so that&#8217;s another thing that&#8217;s also fortunate that there are many corporate sponsors of WordPress podcasts. Although I don&#8217;t consider myself a WordPress podcast, but you know, I guess I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:43] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I guess the people that you&#8217;re interviewing are definitely bound to that subject, but you are very often not dealing with WordPress too much during the conversations, which is I think kind of nice. And we&#8217;ll get onto that in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, do you mind if I obsess about the tech stack there? Because it may be that there&#8217;s people listening to this who have listened to this podcast and it just comes out of their phone or it comes out of their speakers, and they&#8217;ve never really thought too much about the bits and pieces that go on in the background. So let&#8217;s just share our similarities and differences there. What would you say is the tech stack that you&#8217;ve got? What are the three or four things which are essential that you&#8217;ve learned?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:16] Bud Kraus: Well, I start with SquadCast for the recording. And I&#8217;m not an expert on this because I&#8217;m still new at this and I don&#8217;t, you know, I haven&#8217;t used, I&#8217;ve experimented a little bit with Riverside, and I know there&#8217;s a whole bunch of other ones and free ones and this one, but SquadCast, you pay a little bit of money, so what. And I think it&#8217;s really good. You can do audio, you can do video, you can do all kinds of stuff. And then I use Descript to do the editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, everybody has a different workflow. I will use the timeline, I will use the text-based editing. I&#8217;ll do it my way, you&#8217;ll do it your way. It&#8217;s always kind of interesting to learn how people use these tools in different ways. And then after the show is edited, and personally I find the editing to be the best part of the show, which is really, you know, you think talking to the people. Well, that&#8217;s fun but, you know, Nathan, going back to what you were talking about, about listening, I don&#8217;t really hear the show until I start editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the first time I really hear it, because I&#8217;m not concentrating on the questions. I&#8217;m now focused on what the guest had to say. And then it&#8217;s a very creative process. Do you want to shorten the gaps between pauses? Do you want to take out all the ums, sos, you knows, all that stuff? You know, all those words that, the filler words, or do you want to let it fly? Do the Rob Cairn&#8217;s approach, no editing. There&#8217;s different ways of doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am more of a particular on the editing. I like to really clean things up and cut things out, especially if it&#8217;s me talking. I did this episode with Jeff Chandler where we went on and on and on about sports. That all got ripped out because like, come on, we&#8217;re both from Cleveland, Ohio. So you know, we start talking about Cleveland sports, get rid of this, no one&#8217;s going to listen. So I try to think of like the audience too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, the editing is the most fun. A little tedious, but I think the most interesting part. And when it&#8217;s all done, then I run the file through, what did he take? It was a, I forgot what it&#8217;s called. Anyway, I run it through like a cleaner and then I published it to Buzzsprout, which seems to be doing a very good job publishing and putting it on all these platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you don&#8217;t want, you need to have a podcast distribution service. You can&#8217;t go to all these different services and do it yourself. So it&#8217;s kind of, you know, it was sort of, because I had an understanding of technology and how things worked. The learning curve wasn&#8217;t too bad. It was pretty easy actually, when you think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] Nathan Wrigley: I think when I started, I think I started in 2016 or something, it was definitely, it wasn&#8217;t difficult at that point. Many of the hurdles have been overcome, but it&#8217;s certainly easier now. When I did it, I began with Skype, which has just died actually, or at least Microsoft have said they&#8217;re going to kill it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought an app which would go on the Mac, and then that would record. But there was no clever sort of software like you described. We&#8217;re using now SquadCast, which is basically, you open it in the browser, send a link to somebody, and so long as they&#8217;ve got access to the internet and a microphone, we are good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;ll record everything in separate isolated tracks. And then, as you said, both of us will throw it into Descript, which is a piece of software, it&#8217;s actually available in the browser, but you can also download it as app. And you can do all sorts. It&#8217;s amazing what it can do actually. It will bind the transcript that it creates to the timeline. And so you can delete portions of text by highlighting as if you&#8217;re in a Google Doc or something like that, so delete sentences and what have you. And it&#8217;s really sublime. So it&#8217;s much, much more straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m, a bit like you, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the editing experience because you can fiddle with it, can&#8217;t you? And you can decide which bits stay on the edit room floor and which bits go in, and sometimes you go off on different tangents. But the other side of it, that&#8217;s the software side. What are you using to actually record the audio? So microphones and computers and any of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] Bud Kraus: Okay, well, thank you Omnisend, my first sponsor. I have to get that in there, because they bought me, they said, we don&#8217;t want you using that crummy microphone anymore. Go out and buy yourself a nice microphone. Which is, it&#8217;s the same thing that you&#8217;re using. What is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:11] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s a Shure MV7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] Bud Kraus: Yes. And I really like it a lot. I have it on my desktop. I have a desktop stand for it. I have a hard time doing a boom microphone. So it&#8217;s a desktop, and it&#8217;s nice. But you know, you don&#8217;t need, I think a lot of people know, you don&#8217;t need a lot of heavy investment to do a podcast. It&#8217;s almost, talk about a barrier to entry being nothing or next to nothing. Podcasting certainly is that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:35] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, you really, really need very little. You and I have got this modestly priced mic. It&#8217;s not the top tier and it certainly isn&#8217;t the bottom tier. But when I began, for probably four or five years, I had a really cheap mic. And it&#8217;s about where you position it and how far away you are from it and refining all of that and, you know, not breathing too heavily over it and different bits and pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the barrier to entry really is, if you&#8217;ve got a phone, you&#8217;ve got everything that you need, because it&#8217;s got its own microphone built in, it&#8217;ll do a credible job. The audio software will kind of clean it up nicely. And the website, the WordPressy bit is icing on the cake. If you really wanted to keep it cheap and cheerful, Google&#8217;s YouTube will suffice. Really, you could just upload it to YouTube and they now offer podcast as an option. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a video. Well, it needs to be a video, but it doesn&#8217;t have to actually be a picture of you and your guest or anything like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:28] Bud Kraus: I upload, I mean I know I&#8217;m interrupting you, but I have a question. So, where do you think the future of all this podcasting is going? I mean, what&#8217;s podcasting going to be like in a couple of years, according to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:38] Nathan Wrigley: I will give you the answer to that in about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:40] Bud Kraus: I&#8217;m sorry for interrupting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:41] Nathan Wrigley: No, no it&#8217;s fine. I will give you the answer to that in a few weeks time. I&#8217;m going to, one of the biggest podcast shows in the world is held in London every May. I&#8217;m going to be going to that. 10,000 attendees. You know, I&#8217;m in this little WordPress bubble of podcasting, but it&#8217;s an absolutely gigantic industry. It&#8217;s occupying one of the biggest convention spaces in the UK in London, in Islington, if you&#8217;re a person that knows London. I will give you more of an answer then because it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what the trends are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we did have a bit of a bump in credibility in podcasting for a while, and then I think it plateaued a little bit or perhaps went down. But more recently, I think it&#8217;s been going up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I think it remains popular is the same reason that talk radio hasn&#8217;t gone away, is because you can really get into the subject matter. If you&#8217;re really into WordPress, then there&#8217;s a bunch of WordPress things, or if you&#8217;re into, I don&#8217;t know, skiing, there&#8217;ll be skiing podcast and what have you. And the crucial bit for me is that you can do other things at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] Bud Kraus: Well, that&#8217;s where I was going to go too, which is talk about a mobile media. You could take it wherever you go. You don&#8217;t have to sit at a computer or anything, it&#8217;s in your headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:52] Nathan Wrigley: If you&#8217;re stuck in your own house, you know, just doing chores, it can be done at the same time. And even things like mowing the lawn, which is typically quite loud and probably would&#8217;ve gotten in the way, the noise canceling headphones that you can have nowadays. And for me, basically, when I&#8217;m not doing something which requires my eyes to be on something, if I&#8217;m alone and I&#8217;ve got nothing else to do, you can more or less guarantee that I will have a podcast plugged into my headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:19] Bud Kraus: Well, you know, this is the perfect medium for the legally blind. I ought to know, I&#8217;m speaking from experience here, but it is, it&#8217;s all ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:27] Nathan Wrigley: So, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t really have an intuition about where it&#8217;s going to go, but I don&#8217;t see any signs of it as a medium going away. Because I think we all love to listen, well, not all of us, but many of us really enjoy listening to other people and their stories, and their trials and their tribulations and their expertise and whatever it may be. I think it&#8217;s going to stick around</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:50] Bud Kraus: Now, you&#8217;re so lucky because you have those golden pipes, I have nothing. I have this old man&#8217;s voice. God, I would do anything like if AI could clean me up and make me sound like you, I know it could. That gives me an idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:02] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re very kind. I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;ve captured entirely what my.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:06] Bud Kraus: Oh no, I remember, whoa, hold on a second. I first saw you and heard your voice when you were doing the agency summit and you&#8217;re doing all those intros. I don&#8217;t know how long ago was that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:15] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, probably about, I don&#8217;t know, 7 years or something like that, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] Bud Kraus: Yeah. And I was listening. I go, oh, I&#8217;d like to. Who&#8217;s this guy with a voice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:22] Nathan Wrigley: You know we talked about editing bits out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:25] Bud Kraus: That&#8217;s going to be edited out. Don&#8217;t you dare. You better not or you&#8217;ll be hearing from me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:30] Nathan Wrigley: We&#8217;ll see. We&#8217;ll see if it makes it. Okay, let&#8217;s, dig into your podcast. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about how we go about making podcasts. What is the plan? What do you do during that podcast? Yeah, just tell us what you do on typical episode and what are you trying to achieve there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] Bud Kraus: Okay. Well, I&#8217;m trying to get an unexpected conversation. I always say it&#8217;s an unexpected conversation of so and so in the WordPress community. What I do is a guest first has to come to my site and fill out a form, which everybody says is ridiculously long. And I mean, you know, I ask about like almost, every question I could think of. What&#8217;s your blood type? Things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I, before the show starts, I really don&#8217;t do any prep, very little. But before the show starts, I&#8217;ll look at what you submitted, I&#8217;ll look for a question, my first question, whatever it is. And it&#8217;s not going to be like, where were you born? Okay. It&#8217;s going to be like how come you like to smoke or something, you know? What&#8217;s that? It&#8217;ll be something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Off we go. The show does not follow a linear progression, because that&#8217;s, I look at it like if I&#8217;m talking to you like at a bar or something like that. I&#8217;m not going to start from the beginning of your life and go to the end. I&#8217;m going to go back and forth and whatever. It&#8217;s just going to be, it&#8217;s sort of like a show about nothing, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:35] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s like the Seinfeld of podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:38] Bud Kraus: Right, and it works. Seinfeld worked. So I figured maybe this will work. So it goes back and forth and I try not to talk too much about WordPress. Usually I&#8217;ll say something like, okay, let&#8217;s talk about WordPress. You know, what do you do? And then if I feel like the guest is talking about anything, I&#8217;ll just jump in and go, okay, that&#8217;s enough of that, and we&#8217;ll go on to something else. When you&#8217;re in real life, at least for me, I&#8217;m rude enough to say to somebody, okay, enough, let&#8217;s go on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] Nathan Wrigley: So the intention then is to sort of figure out the personality behind the thing. So let&#8217;s say, for example, it&#8217;s somebody that we&#8217;ve all heard of in the WordPress space, they&#8217;ve got a thing, we&#8217;re all familiar with the thing that they&#8217;ve got. Okay, we know that about them. That&#8217;s a given. So your idea is to drill in and figure out, okay, just tell us something quirky and interesting about you, your life, and let&#8217;s talk about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:23] Bud Kraus: Yeah, I mean, I try to ask like crazy questions to elicit some unusual, crazy response. And sometimes it happens, you know? Sometimes it does and sometimes it does. A couple of things. one I find the older you are, the more interesting you are to me, because you&#8217;ve lived a life. I don&#8217;t have anything against 25 year olds. I&#8217;ve had them on the show, but they don&#8217;t have the breadth of time that I&#8217;m looking for. That&#8217;s one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other thing is some of the people I know very well, and some of the people I don&#8217;t know at all. I think Brian Gardner, I didn&#8217;t know Brian, and I had a great time talking, you know? or Andrew Palmer, wow, those were so much fun. So it isn&#8217;t necessarily. In fact, to me, those are the best episodes when I don&#8217;t know the person, because I just, I&#8217;m more inquisitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] Nathan Wrigley: How do you handle, or maybe you&#8217;ve not had one yet, how do you handle the guest who is not quite as talkative as you&#8217;d hoped for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] Bud Kraus: Boy, that&#8217;s a good question. I&#8217;ve had a few of those. I just do the best I can. You know, I mean, everybody&#8217;s a little different. You know, the other thing too is I do interviews with people that English is not their first language, and you&#8217;ve got to keep that in mind. You&#8217;ve got to give them the space to go slow, let them talk, and then do a lot of editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because what they tend to do is have what I call warmup words, where they&#8217;ll say the, the, the, the, and I don&#8217;t want four the&#8217;s, one is enough, So I&#8217;ll cut out the three the&#8217;s. That&#8217;s very typical of somebody where English is not the native language, because they&#8217;re thinking of how to say something. And I don&#8217;t necessarily think that makes for a good listening experience. So out it goes, and then they sound really good. You know, and I can think of a whole lot of people that, you know, I&#8217;d made them sound a whole lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I want to tell you another little quirky thing about the show. I always think like, well, when I do Nathan Wrigley, which I&#8217;ve done, right? wow, everybody&#8217;s going to be listening to that episode, you know? Because he&#8217;s so well known. Now this is not necessarily you Nathan, but it doesn&#8217;t work that way. It does not work that way. At the end of the day, I&#8217;ve realised I don&#8217;t know how many people listen to an episode, there&#8217;s so many factors. But one of them is not how well known they are. That is not a factor. Contrary to Bob Dunn, who when I first started this, he said, well, if they know the person, if people are really well known, then everybody will listen to that episode. Not true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] Nathan Wrigley: Well, I guess maybe there&#8217;s that whole thing, who would listen to a podcast with me on it, because they can always listen to podcast with me on it, because that&#8217;s what I do. So yeah, that makes sense. And also, if you&#8217;ve heard from them, whoever the guest may be in a thousand different places, then yeah, I can understand that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:57] Bud Kraus: It turned out to be sort of like the lesser known people, if you will. They get more plays. It&#8217;s just that people are just more curious. You know, they maybe they&#8217;ve heard of that person and they&#8217;re a little more curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, here&#8217;s the other thing that really increases. If so and so, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s somebody in India or Australia or whatever, you know If they wanted to share this with their family and their friends, I see a lot of that kind of stuff going on. You get a lot of plays. So I look at, my podcast as not a WordPress podcast per se, and that&#8217;s why I think it has legs and, potential beyond the WordPress world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:28] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that was another question I was going to ask. Because you&#8217;re not really bound by anything other than, here&#8217;s a human being who can speak, and they&#8217;ve got a story to tell in some way, or at least we&#8217;ll try and pull a story out of them. I was going to ask if you were going to expand it beyond WordPress and just see where it leads you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:43] Bud Kraus: I have no interest, but I have people coming, friends and stuff, will you interview me and stuff? No, I&#8217;m not interested. I don&#8217;t have time for that kind of stuff, There&#8217;s enough fascinating people in the WordPress world, and it&#8217;s definitely a way for people to get to know other people in the WordPress, see that&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s a platform. So that they can get to know you, me, whoever it is, beyond the typical, what&#8217;s your WordPress journey stuff, or what do you do with WordPress? It&#8217;s the story. It&#8217;s the person. It&#8217;s the biography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:09] Nathan Wrigley: Have you ever had episodes that you were not able to get something that you&#8217;d hoped out of it? So in other words, you pressed record and then by the time you&#8217;d finished the episode, you thought, oh gosh, that didn&#8217;t work out as anticipated, or that just went off the rails, or there was nothing of interest there. Let&#8217;s can that one and either retry it or just bin it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:30] Bud Kraus: Well, I&#8217;ve had two, one episode that the interviewee said, I don&#8217;t want you to air this, so, okay, I didn&#8217;t. And then another one said, there was a whole thing about something that this person said, I had it cut out because this person did not want me to air it. So I did. But for the most part, no. Now some of them I get off and I go, wow, that was really great. I do have that, like, whoa, what a story. And then sometimes it&#8217;s just okay, it didn&#8217;t go anywhere, or I thought it&#8217;d be better or whatever. So, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know everybody that I interview and, the more I do this, the fewer people I really know, which is good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:07] Nathan Wrigley: I set the expectations, like I said, with shared show notes, but also prior to hitting record, I mean, I know you so we didn&#8217;t do so much of that, but I always make time to, maybe even like half an hour or something just to chat before we hit record. So I&#8217;ll make sure that we just talk. And very, very often, very often I will do a call with somebody who wants to be on the podcast but doesn&#8217;t know if they can do a podcast. And we&#8217;ll just have a chat. And at the end of that chat, I&#8217;ll say, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like. Do you want to record it another day? And I&#8217;ve yet to find somebody that&#8217;s turned me down on that basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:45] Bud Kraus: You know, that&#8217;s an excellent point. because I&#8217;ve had a few people where English is not their language and they&#8217;ll say, well, I&#8217;ve never done a podcast. Now Anna Hurko, I was the first person, right the CEO of Crocoblock. My podcast was her first, her episode went through the roof. Absolutely went through the roof. And now you can&#8217;t get her off podcasts Like I see, she&#8217;s everywhere now, which is great. I love it. And you know, English is not her first. She speaks 85 languages, so it was great. Anna was fun. It&#8217;s an adventure. I guess it&#8217;s fun. I mean, God, Nathan, I have fun at everything I do, whether I&#8217;m writing, or spot podcasting or, you know, talking to you even.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:23] Nathan Wrigley: Even, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:24] Bud Kraus: One last thing I was about before the show, I try to keep that very short. Because I don&#8217;t want to not record something that&#8217;s really good. And I&#8217;ve noticed that a lot of really good stuff was being said before and after the recording. So I don&#8217;t want for that to happen. I want it to be recorded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:40] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting because I have the opposite intuition. I have the intuition that if I get to know them, and put them at their ease, that rapport that is built up over 20 minutes or half an hour, will then lead to a better experience because we&#8217;ll both feel a little bit more relaxed and comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:54] Bud Kraus: Well, for what you do and how you do it, that makes a lot of sense. For me, it doesn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m going to leave stuff out. Now, here&#8217;s the problem though, and you probably realize this too. If you don&#8217;t know somebody, you don&#8217;t have a pre-established speaking pattern, and you tend to step on their words and they tend to step on yours. But like you and I, we pretty much have talked to each other, you know, for a while and different times. And so we now know, this is when I stop and this is when he stopped. You know, that kind of thing. It&#8217;s really hard when you&#8217;re first talking to somebody on a podcast and you don&#8217;t know them, boy, you&#8217;re going to be stepping on each other like crazy, in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:29] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of curious. So here&#8217;s an interesting thought then. You said that you&#8217;re enjoying it, which is lovely. I still very much enjoy doing podcasting. I have to pinch myself. What about the scenario where you have made podcasting the center, the fulcrum of what you do, and how you earn your money, and the sponsorships and all of those kinds of things. And then what if you don&#8217;t enjoy it anymore? Would it be a bit like the clients, would you be willing at that point to drop podcasting? Or do you feel like this is you for life now, this is what you&#8217;re doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:58] Bud Kraus: This is it now. I have to say, there are some days, if you ask my wife, that I get, oh, it&#8217;s not growing. It&#8217;s like flattened out. It&#8217;s like, she goes, because I realise well, what else are you going to do? There&#8217;s nothing else for you to do. This is like the perfect thing for legally blind people. What else are you going to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:14] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re going to keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:15] Bud Kraus: Well, as long as, I mean, I&#8217;m not a kid. I&#8217;m sort of, you know, on the senior side of life. But there&#8217;s no reason to stop as long as I can keep doing it, you know? And I just got started doing it, so who knows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:26] Nathan Wrigley: The barrier to entry is low. The enjoyment is high. So it sounds like the perfect way to spend the next few years certainly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve discovered that about 35 to 40 minutes is about the sweet spot for a podcast episode, because it seems be the attention span that most people have got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is a neat little segue for me to say we&#8217;re at minute 37 and a half, which is more or less exactly in the middle of that sweet spot. So I&#8217;m going to ask you just to sort of sign off. Tell us where we can find you. Where is the website, as in the URL? I know we&#8217;ve said the name of the podcast many, many times, but where can we find you? And where do we find you on socials and things like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:03] Bud Kraus: Oh God. Alright I have a website called seriouslybud.com It&#8217;s kind of easy to remember if you can remember the name. One little quick thing, I know we&#8217;re running out of time. It doesn&#8217;t have the word WordPress or WP in it, which is different than a lot of podcasts. So it could be done for anything. And it wasn&#8217;t a name that I came up with. It was my graphic designer came up with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, seriouslybud.com Now, the good thing about that is you can get all the episodes from the past. It&#8217;s very easy to access all those episodes. And eventually I&#8217;m going to be launching a blog which will discuss the show, the people in the show, the behind the scenes, all that kinda stuff. So I&#8217;m working on that. And as far as social, just, Bud Kraus, or seriously bud? That&#8217;s Kraus, No, E. Only one S. How&#8217;s that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:45] Nathan Wrigley: Perfect. I will make sure that those links and any others that we mentioned during the course of this recording go into the show notes. Head to wptavern.com/podcast, search for the episode with Bud Kraus. And, Bud, it just remains for me to say thank you very much for chatting to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:00] Bud Kraus: It&#8217;s always a pleasure to talk to. Well, let&#8217;s just say this. The pleasure was all yours, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:05] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re too modest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:07] Bud Kraus: Alright, take care.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://seriouslybud.com/\">Bud Kraus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s name might ring a bell in the WordPress community, not only for his teaching and writing, but also as the host of the “Seriously, BUD?” podcast. Bud’s WordPress journey started back in 2009 when a client told him he had to learn WordPress, and ever since he’s been immersed in all aspects of it: from building sites, to teaching, to creating content for major WordPress businesses. These days, Bud calls himself a WordPress content creative, focusing mainly on producing articles, videos, and of course, his own podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we turn the microphone around on Bud to talk about his transition from site building to content creation. He shares how the “Seriously, BUD?” podcast came out of a desire to have real, unscripted conversations with people from around the WordPress community. Chats that go beyond plugins and code, and dig into the stories, quirks, and lives of the people behind the tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the format of the show, Bud’s techniques for bringing out interesting stories, and the importance of really listening to guests.

RC1 is to be ready for testing on April 28, 2025, and the final release two days later on April 30th, 2025. Here are the main issues that will be resolved with this release:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63285\">Call to undefined function is_super_admin() in /wp-includes/ms-files.php</a>&nbsp;(This&nbsp;ticket&nbsp;is complete)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/69923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Regression in WP 6.8 – Meta boxes area shows unwanted resize handle (&lt;button role=”separator”>) and breaks auto-scroll</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/68139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keyboard Shortcuts: Revert delete shortcut to access + z</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his post <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/defining-minor-releases-for-wordpress-6-8-x/\"><strong>Defining Minor Releases for WordPress 6.8.x</strong></a>, <strong>Aaron Jorbin</strong>, WordPress core committer, outlines recommendations for handling minor releases in WordPress 6.8.x, given the move to a yearly major release schedule. He argues that minor releases should be more risk-averse than majors, especially since everyone gets minor updates automatically and WordPress does not maintain multiple older versions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key Points: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No new files in minor releases: </strong>Adding new files can break auto-updates for some users and is considered too risky.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Risk aversion:</strong> Keep changes minimal and package sizes small to reduce update failures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>New features</strong> are allowed if they are well-tested and not too large, but major changes (like big redesigns) should be avoided.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Refactors:</strong> Either avoid coding standard refactors or only backport them selectively alongside other necessary changes to avoid unnecessary package bloat.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Default themes:</strong> Focus on improving existing default themes (e.g., adding new patterns) rather than introducing new ones in minor releases.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Overall, the emphasis is on stability, minimal risk, and maintaining reliable automatic updates for security and maintenance.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f399.png\" alt=\"🎙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Latest episode: <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-116-wordpress-6-8-field-guide/\">Gutenberg Changelog 116 – WordPress 6.8, Source of Truth, Field Guide, Gutenberg 20.5 and 20.6</a> with special guest JC Palmes, WebDev Studios</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-05-at-12.27.14.png?resize=652%2C184&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-39894\" />\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of The WordPress Way, <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/first-time-contributors-and-wordpress-6-8-enhancements-with-birgit-pauli-haack-and-joe-mcgill\"><strong>Exciting Highlights of WordPress 6.8 Release and Community Impact</strong></a>, I&#8217;m thrilled to be joined by my<br />fellow core contributors, <strong>Joe McGill</strong> and <strong>Abha Thakor</strong>, as we celebrate<br />the arrival of WordPress 6.8.

The block allows developers to easily create responsive and interactive<br />carousels with minimal code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using a declarative syntax, users can simply define the content and layout they want to display, eliminating the need for complex JavaScript logic. This approach enables faster development and easier maintenance of carousel components across various websites.

Within a short amount of time, clients can start producing Block-based content, while your old Classic setup powers the rest of your website.

Some of it, I believe, is misplaced—but I also understand where it’s coming from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The passing of Pope Francis has deeply impacted me. While I still disagree with the Church on many issues, he was the Pope who broke the mold in so many ways, inspiring me and drawing me back to the Catholic faith I grew up with, with an emphasis on service, compassion, and humility. His passing on Easter Monday, a holiday about rebirth, feels historic. Moments like that invite reflection—not just on personal choices, but on the broader systems we’re a part of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My life, which was primarily about generative creative work that was free for everyone to use, has been subsumed by legal battles. From the start, I’ve said this: after many rounds of negotiation that I approached in good faith, WPE chose to sue. In hindsight, those conversations weren’t held in the same spirit, and that’s unfortunate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we can’t rewrite the past. What we can do is decide how we move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The maker-taker problem, at the heart of what we’ve been wrestling with, doesn’t disappear by avoiding it. If we’re serious about contributing to the future of open source, and about preserving the legacy of what we’ve built together, we need space to reset. That can’t happen under the weight of ongoing litigation. The cards are in WPE hands, a fight they&#8217;ve started and refuse to end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’m asking for a moment of reflection for us all as stewards of a shared ecosystem.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, what&#8217;s new for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher. Ryan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He focuses on removing barriers to adoption for developers working with Gutenberg and WordPress. He&#8217;s a seasoned WordPress developer, and regular contributor to WordPress and the Gutenberg project. He also streams on Twitch as RyanWelcherCodes, where he focuses on custom block development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview was recorded at WordCamp Asia 2025 in Manila, where Ryan was giving his Block Developer Cookbook workshop for the second year running. Ryan spends much of his time creating documentation, running live streams, and writing articles, explaining the knots and bolts of new WordPress features for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He shares his journey from admiring the platform evangelists of the Flash era, to finding his own dream job helping developers understand and implement the new technologies in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about some of the biggest recent updates to WordPress Core, including the Block Bindings API, Plugin Template Registration API, Preview Options API, and the new Data Views. Ryan breaks down what these new tools are, why they matter, and how they&#8217;re making WordPress Block development both more powerful and more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also discusses the growing emphasis on intentional high quality documentation and resources over the past few years, and how many teams are working to make life easier for developers of all skill levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the balance between the increasing flexibility of WordPress&#8217; UI, and the risk of overwhelming new users, as well as exploring how emerging technologies like AI are shaping the future for WordPress developers and hobbyists alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in what&#8217;s new in WordPress development, want to understand where the project is heading, or are curious about the real impact of recent changes and features, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ryan Welcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Ryan Welcher. Hello, Ryan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] Ryan Welcher: Hello. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I&#8217;m good. Very nice to meet you. This is my second interview in Manila. It&#8217;s WordCamp Asia. You have a presentation coming up. No. You&#8217;ve got a workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:47] Ryan Welcher: I do. Yeah. I&#8217;m really excited. It&#8217;s actually the second year in a row that I&#8217;ve given this workshop at WordCamp Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:52] Nathan Wrigley: And it&#8217;s a sellout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] Ryan Welcher: It is a sellout, yeah. And not in the bad way. It&#8217;s a sellout in the sense that there&#8217;s a wait list apparently and everything. So I&#8217;m very excited. I&#8217;m very flattered and very excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Nathan Wrigley: So before we get stuck into what it is that you are doing here, and that&#8217;s going to be the focus of this conversation around the topic of, well, I&#8217;ll explain that in a moment. Would you just tell us a little bit about who you are, what kind of work you do in the WordPress space and who you work for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] Ryan Welcher: Sure. Well, I am a developer advocate. I&#8217;m sponsored by Automattic. I&#8217;ve been with Automattic for, I guess it&#8217;s going to be my third year. Prior to that I was, I used to work at 10up, I&#8217;ve been at a bunch of agencies. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress as a developer since maybe 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been around in this space a while and, yeah, my current role is a lot of fun. I get to do things like this. I get to chat with people in exotic places, and go to conferences and lead workshops and write code that nobody ever has to use in production. It&#8217;s fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:43] Nathan Wrigley: So you&#8217;ve got a really public facing role. Is that the kind of job that you&#8217;ve always wished to do, or is it something that you more or less fell into?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] Ryan Welcher: If you&#8217;ll indulge me with a bit of an anecdotal story here. When I first started in web work, I used to do a lot of work with Flash. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m aging myself by saying that, but we used to do a lot of work in Flash. And there was this conference called Flash in the Can, and it&#8217;s still around now, it&#8217;s not called that anymore. And there was this guy who used to work for Adobe, his name was Lee Brimlow. I think that&#8217;s how you say it. He was a platform evangelist. His job was literally go to conferences and give really fun, cool talks on the latest, greatest in Flash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I remember seeing this guy, going, this is like my dream job. This is phenomenal. And I just wasn&#8217;t at a place in my career where there was anything like that. And then, fast forward however many years later, and there was an opening for Dev Rel. And I was like, yes, this is exactly what I would love to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love writing code. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed being a developer, but now this is kind of like, I&#8217;m also pretty outgoing, extroverted, so this kind of fills both. You know, I get to write code and like my dream is just like sitting down writing code with some obscure API, and that&#8217;s literally all, like I just get to tinker, and that&#8217;s what I love about it. It&#8217;s so much fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:50] Nathan Wrigley: And is that full-time then?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] Ryan Welcher: It is, yeah. I&#8217;m full-time. Yeah, it is fun. It is very cool. And I realise fully how lucky I am, because this is a fun job and I get to hang out with really cool people all the time. And being public facing is fun, but it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s got its downsides too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:06] Nathan Wrigley: We have this expression in the UK and it&#8217;s called painting the Forth Bridge. And there&#8217;s this bridge in Scotland called the Forth Bridge, and essentially when you&#8217;ve finished painting it from one end, you go to the other end and begin again. And I feel that WordPress, maybe for somebody in your position, is a little bit like that. It&#8217;s this constant treadmill of, okay, that&#8217;s changed. Yeah. Now we need to adapt new content. And yeah, okay, that bit&#8217;s changed over there in the meantime. New content. Is that what it&#8217;s like a bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:37] Ryan Welcher: A little bit, yeah. I mean it&#8217;s, when we started, there wasn&#8217;t really a Dev Rel team for the open source project that is WordPress. We were like, you know, there&#8217;s a joke, it&#8217;s like, yeah, there&#8217;s five of us or six of us for 43% of the internet. So there&#8217;s like a lot of work to be done, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a lot of that. We are doing a lot of work around documentation and all that sort of stuff, so it&#8217;s like improving that. But every release, there&#8217;s like a new cycle of things that, you know, the new stuff like 6.7, all the block binding stuff and, you know, Interactivity API and all that really cool, fun stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we get to do that, but then it&#8217;s like, okay, well then now there&#8217;s new changes to the Interactivity API, so we have to kind of like talk about that a bit and stuff. It&#8217;s always new, but then there&#8217;s always, I love it when we&#8217;re like, hey, remember that bug that people have been talking about for two years? Like, oh, it&#8217;s fixed now. So we get to also be the harbinger of really good news about things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] Nathan Wrigley: And do you get to put your own roster together of work each week, or does it come in from on high?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:28] Ryan Welcher: We kind of, it&#8217;s usually based around the next release. So whatever&#8217;s coming out in the next release, there&#8217;s always sort of like, you know, the featured items that are coming out. So that kind of dictates what we focus on for the next release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no like on high declaration of what we need to work on. It&#8217;s more like we&#8217;re fairly autonomous in what we do, but I mean, it makes the most sense. If there&#8217;s like new features coming with the next version of WordPress, we should probably get that out and, you know, talk to developers and get people testing it and get people working with it, so we can take that feedback, good and bad, and give it back to the teams that are actually working on those features and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] Nathan Wrigley: So given that it&#8217;s a Dev Rel job, developer relations, is that your target audience? It&#8217;s definitely developers, a hundred percent developers, not novices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be a 101 article on how to use WordPress or, you know, a video piece of content or something like that. Right up to, okay, here&#8217;s the nuts and the bolts of exactly how this thing works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:22] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, exactly. Like, I did an article on the developer blog, developer.wordpress.org/news. It was on like the internals of webpack, which is like, if you&#8217;ve ever messed with webpack, nobody ever wants to deal with internals of webpack, but WordPress handles it. It does this really elegant thing where you don&#8217;t have to actually install packages that WordPress provides. It kind of like all of a sudden just uses the ones that are coming, that are with the install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like explaining all that, it&#8217;s cool, I get to nerd out and get right into the details but, you know, it&#8217;s not for everyone. Yeah, but then we&#8217;re like, I&#8217;ve also written our articles on like an introduction to SlotFill or an introduction to Block Variation so, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:55] Nathan Wrigley: It feels like, if we were to rewind the clock like three or four years, there wasn&#8217;t so much emphasis put on documentation, knowledge base articles, video content, learn.wordpress.org. But it feels like in the last two or three years, a much greater emphasis has been put on getting the pieces of documentation right. Getting the Learn resources, you know, putting the courses together and those kind of things. Just looking at it from the outside, that&#8217;s what I think. But is this on the internal side, is this what&#8217;s happening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely a focus on that. I mean, when you&#8217;re a developer and you don&#8217;t have the resources to get the answers that you&#8217;re looking for, that&#8217;s extremely frustrating. We&#8217;ve always had documentation, we&#8217;ve had, you know, it&#8217;s like 20-year-old documentation. It&#8217;s been around a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time improving that. Like, we&#8217;ve focused a lot on the Block Editor Handbook because block development is something that can be very difficult, especially if you&#8217;re coming from, you know, solely a PHP background, and you&#8217;re not really up to speed on React or you just don&#8217;t know JavaScript as deeply as other folks do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, our job is to like make that transition easier, as much as possible, right? So that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a lot of tooling around it that abstracts away the things, like the scripts package, which is like the build process that the Gutenberg plugin uses it, but it&#8217;s also like the defacto build process for building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That handles all that webpack stuff, that handles all that config stuff. You just have to like build your files. Like, you don&#8217;t have to worry about that. So there&#8217;s a lot of trying to make life easier, simpler. And a lot of that is in improvements to documentation, but there&#8217;s also like quality of life fixes for people who are working in the code specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, like I spent a lot of time working, like the Create Block package is like my baby. I absolutely love it. It&#8217;s not my baby, like I didn&#8217;t build it, I&#8217;ve just been trying to maintain it as much as I can and adding new features to make life a little bit easier so you can like reuse it and, I don&#8217;t know, I could get into the minute details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I love that kind of stuff because as a developer, having been one for a long time, I know what I like and I think, I&#8217;m not saying like, what I like everyone should like, but I know when something is getting in my way versus helping me. And I think that&#8217;s a really, that&#8217;s kind of like my compass that I try to work with. It&#8217;s like, okay, it&#8217;s great, but it&#8217;s done all these things I don&#8217;t need, now I have to go and delete all that and figure out all this other stuff to get around this scaffold and, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m really in the weeds right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, yeah. But it feels like, I&#8217;m kind of asking the same question again really, about the materials being created in a much more, well, intentional way. Yeah, the backstory to that, presumably though, is that there&#8217;s more boots on the ground. And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s, in your case, it&#8217;s Automattic sponsoring you into the project. Is there more focus on that from, well, let&#8217;s just go from the Auttomatic side, so more investment from them, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if that&#8217;s the case, is that a reaction to anything? Like, perhaps the rise of SaaS platforms, proprietary platforms, you know, the Wixs and the Squarespaces. Because that&#8217;s interesting. It kind of feels like that&#8217;s always been talked about, you know, WordPress versus all the other platforms. Pay your $20 over there per month, and you get this, and you get access to their platform and it&#8217;s well documented and so on. So I didn&#8217;t know if it was connected to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:57] Ryan Welcher: I don&#8217;t think there was any, I think that the rise of Dev Rel played a large part in that. Like, I don&#8217;t know the reasoning behind the creation of the team, that was decided before I joined. But I think that in the past four and five years, there&#8217;s been a real, like just across the tech community, there&#8217;s been a real like surge in the concept of developer relations and improving developer experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think people realise that developers, like a lot of these platforms, developers are literally their client base, right? And so I think Automattic recognised that and thought, hey, it&#8217;d be great if we had a dedicated team of folks that were just making life easier for developers. You know, I always say that there&#8217;s no, like I have no KPIs or whatever, I just make things, my mandate is to make things better, as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:40] Nathan Wrigley: Where do you make things? So is it things like YouTube videos, written documentation, knowledge base articles, blog posts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:48] Ryan Welcher: A bit of everything. I tend to focus a bit more on the, like I have a live stream that I do on Twitch every Thursday at 10:30 Eastern. I tend to do a lot more of that sort of stuff. That&#8217;s kind of like more my wheelhouse. I write articles. I&#8217;m not the best writer. I rely on ChatGPT to help me clean that up a little bit. I write the articles, but then I, you know, smarter brains than I help me make it nicer to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I think we all, like everyone across our team has their own sort of strengths and we all kind of like play to our strengths a bit. Mine is definitely more like in the video side. I try to use my development experience as much as possible to do more complicated things. That&#8217;s not to say that the other folks on our team don&#8217;t either, but, I mean, I think I&#8217;m in a position to be able to be like, here&#8217;s a really complicated issue that people are having and how would we solve that? And it&#8217;s fun because I get paid to solve that. And other people who have clients that don&#8217;t want to pay them 20 hours just to fart around on a problem is, that&#8217;s where I can come in and help with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:39] Nathan Wrigley: Give that to us again though. Where do you do your YouTube stuff? And what handle would that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:44] Ryan Welcher: I stream on Twitch and YouTube. I multistream to both platforms. Thursdays, 10:30 Eastern, every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:50] Nathan Wrigley: And what handle would that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:52] Ryan Welcher: Ryan Welcher Codes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] Nathan Wrigley: We&#8217;ll drop all of the links that we stumble across during this episode into the show notes. Yeah, so you can find it all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp Asia, the workshop that you are giving is called the Block Developer Cookbook. And I am just going to read the blurb so that you, dear listener, get some idea of what it is that Ryan&#8217;s doing. And it says, this is the second year for the Block Developer Cookbook Workshop at WordCamp Asia. Last year in Taipei, we covered lots of topics like block transforms, adding editorial notes, creating a custom format and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, in addition to the existing recipes from the last year, we will have new ones to choose from that leverage the newest features released in WordPress 6.7, such as Block Bindings API, Plugin Template Registration API, Preview Options API and more. And there&#8217;ll be a workshop all about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think your intention at this workshop, should the internet hold up, is to do like an interactive thing where the audience say, I want to do this, and you hopefully help them out with that because that&#8217;s very brave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:58] Ryan Welcher: You can say that, yeah. I&#8217;ve had this idea for a while of a workshop where the attendees pick the content. Because, especially with a topic like block development, it&#8217;s like saying, come to my WordPress workshop. Like, there&#8217;s so many things, right? So like picking something for everyone is really hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I thought, well you know what? I&#8217;ll build this little website and they can go in. It&#8217;s like chef theme because it&#8217;s block developer cookbooks. So, you know, you login, you have a little chef hat on your avatar and stuff like that. But you can vote on which of the recipes that you&#8217;d like to work on. And so that&#8217;s the idea. And then they vote and then we go from top to bottom. We get as many done as we can in the 90 minutes or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been going to conferences and speaking at conferences long enough to know better than to rely on the wifi, but I thought, I&#8217;m just going to do it. So this is the second year in a row. I did this last year as well at Taipei. So I&#8217;m like super flattered that they accepted my submission is a second time in a row, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:49] Nathan Wrigley: I think there&#8217;s a push to make WordCamps a little bit more, and I&#8217;m going to use air quotes, exciting, interactive. Yeah, it seems like, you know, Jamie Marsland&#8217;s, the thing that he does with the Speed Builds, just sort of grabbing the attention of the audience a bit more. Does it feel a bit like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And workshops, they seem to grab the audience a little bit more, because it&#8217;s more interactive. It&#8217;s kind of less being presented to and more interacting with. So I don&#8217;t know, kind of opening up the laptop, trying things out. What do you think? Is that a way that you think events should go in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:23] Ryan Welcher: I think so too. I think for me personally, I gravitate towards workshops more than talks. I&#8217;ve given talks and I&#8217;ve done workshops before and I think I enjoy, personally enjoy the workshop aspect because there&#8217;s a lot more like interaction and back and forth. And like if you have a question, you just raise your hand and we answer, you know. And it&#8217;s just more organic, I guess is maybe how I&#8217;d describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, I think you&#8217;re right. These sort of like fun interactive things. I have some 3D printed swag that I&#8217;m bringing. I don&#8217;t have nearly enough, so I&#8217;m going to have to come up with a, maybe whoever asks a question gets a, it&#8217;s a little like key chain of like a chef hat with the WordCamp 2025 on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:57] Nathan Wrigley: I am sure it&#8217;ll come out on WordPress TV at some point in the near future. But yeah, good luck with that at least anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some of the bits and pieces that you are going to be talking about, we&#8217;re going to get into that now. And the way I want to take this interview is we&#8217;re at WordPress 6.7 at this point. It depends really on when you&#8217;re listening to this, but we&#8217;re at that point at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a whole bunch of stuff that has dropped, and I feel that the audience for this podcast, there&#8217;s a ton of developers. But there&#8217;s also lots of people who are not really inside the ecosystem too much. You know, just regular users. Maybe they&#8217;re using a page builder, maybe they&#8217;re a freelancer, something like that, and they don&#8217;t follow the project, they don&#8217;t really obsess about it as much as I do, and probably as you do as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s just take a couple of these and discuss them. And if we could go in at a low level. So we&#8217;re not able to do a video and open a code editor on this podcast, it&#8217;s all about the audio, but let&#8217;s start talking about the Block Bindings API. What does it do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] Ryan Welcher: Oh, I love the Block Bindings API. So there has been a long standing need in WordPress to be able to connect custom meta or custom fields with displaying them basically. And so, in classic themes, we would always just have a meta box that you would put some stuff in, and then in your templates you would just pull that information out of the database and show it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With block themes, it&#8217;s a little bit different because we don&#8217;t really have, you can do that in some places, anyways. The idea behind Block Bindings is that you can connect a block with a piece of post meta, or a custom field and have it display. So you take a paragraph block, let&#8217;s use the example of like a personnel list maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you&#8217;ve got like job description, you&#8217;ve got the date hired, all these pieces of metadata. And so what you can do with the Block Bindings API is you can connect that to say a paragraph block. So you can insert just a regular old paragraph block and then in the UI you can go over and say, okay, I want to connect the content field of that paragraph block with this piece of post meta. And it just shows up in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you can actually edit it in the block editor, as opposed to having to open up like the custom fields panel down at the bottom. You can edit it and it goes both ways. And it&#8217;s like extremely powerful. It&#8217;s the beginning of how powerful it&#8217;s going to get, but currently it supports, there&#8217;s four blocks that are supported. There&#8217;s the paragraph block, header block, the image block, and the button block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have to use one of those four blocks, unless you want to get into custom bindings, which is sort of the second piece of it, which is like a means of defining your own binding sources. And then you can connect those binding sources to a block as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you wanted to connect to any sort of custom field manager plugin that&#8217;s out there, you could write your own that connects to that, and then you can have the block just read from that and it&#8217;s inline. You get a visual representation of it. It&#8217;s really, really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:41] Nathan Wrigley: So it&#8217;s the kind of thing that in the past you would probably have got a plugin to do. Something like, I don&#8217;t know, maybe you would&#8217;ve downloaded Pods or something like that to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:50] Ryan Welcher: I mean, it doesn&#8217;t manage the custom fields for you. So some of those plugins do that very, very well. But what it does do is it connects the block editor with that meta, which has been the missing piece for a while. It&#8217;s still kind of in its infancy, but already it&#8217;s shown to be super powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, now we&#8217;re seeing a lot of people who are not writing custom blocks for this anymore. Like, it used to be like, okay, I want to show the job description, so I have to write a custom block that introduces something in the sidebar where you input the meta there and then that block displays that because you&#8217;re handling that, it&#8217;s a dynamic block, you&#8217;re pulling the meta out and the PHP, all that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you don&#8217;t have to do that. Now you can just do a block variation of a paragraph block to auto set the meta that you want. You don&#8217;t even have to do that. You can do it right in the admin. But I would recommend doing a block variation, because setting that up every single time is a bit tedious. And especially if you&#8217;re doing it for clients, you can just do a block variation that says like, job description, and then you click on it and it just goes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:46] Nathan Wrigley: So you, your face, gave away something a moment ago. And it sounds like you are quite excited about what&#8217;s coming and is not yet there. But I guess one of the nice things about your job is that you really have that high level view of what&#8217;s going on in the project. And you can imagine scenarios in the near term, maybe 6.8 or something like that. For example, in this case, the Block Bindings API will enable novice users to do, well, more than you&#8217;ve just described. Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of a nice position to be in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:13] Ryan Welcher: I don&#8217;t have, I will say this for the record, I don&#8217;t have an inside track to anything that&#8217;s not available on like Make. But I know some of the folks that are working on it, and like just in conversation, I&#8217;m very excited. I can see where it&#8217;s going, and that&#8217;s not because I have inside information, it&#8217;s just because the logical next step, it looks really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, more blocks. Being able to do it with custom blocks will be huge once you have a custom block that you can now connect it to meta and stuff like that. There are some technical hurdles that need to be addressed to do that, but it&#8217;s going to be a big, I hate using the word game changer, but it&#8217;s going to be a game changer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] Nathan Wrigley: One of the things which I always find interesting when I speak to people who are really in the weeds of it all, is that the stuff just, well, it just keeps on coming out. Because you are in there every day and it&#8217;s so self-evident to you. You know, you use all these acronyms, you know where everything connects, and you know how to make everything work. How do you feel like that is project wide?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re sort of going off piste a little bit here, but we&#8217;ll come back to your presentation, your workshop in a minute. How straightforward is it for people to keep up to date with this, and where would you point them? If somebody was really wanting to find out, for example, about the Block Bindings API, where&#8217;s the best place?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think what I&#8217;m trying to say is, there&#8217;s so much coming that it&#8217;s hard to keep up, for somebody that it isn&#8217;t paid to do it like you are. Is the documentation easy to find? There&#8217;s not really a question in there, but it&#8217;s just a, well, everything&#8217;s just coming so quickly, so fast, and it&#8217;s so disparate and you&#8217;ve got to spend, you know, like a whole week trying to track everything down and map everything to everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] Ryan Welcher: I would say start with, it is a bit like drinking from the fire hose for sure. Like, there&#8217;s a lot of information. You&#8217;ve got stuff on the make.wordpress.org. where they sort of talk about what&#8217;s coming. You&#8217;ve got the Gutenberg releases. Like the Gutenberg, it&#8217;s on a two week release cycle, so there&#8217;s constant things coming out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one really great way of keeping up with that is there&#8217;s a, what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg post that comes out every two weeks, that talks about high level features. And then it&#8217;s got like a change log of everything that was merged in those two weeks. So that&#8217;s a really great way to like see what&#8217;s coming at a higher level, but also really get in the weeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you can say, okay, this bug that I know about, oh look, they fixed it or whatever. That&#8217;s a really great place to start. You can hang out in the WordPress Slack where they do the Core Editor meetings, the Block Editor meetings, and sort of like ask questions in the open floor or just see what people are talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on what you&#8217;re trying to do, the GitHub repo is kind of an okay place to get some information. You&#8217;re going to get a lot of information, but that would be a place. I mean, it&#8217;s, I do it full time and it&#8217;s hard, so I get it. But the reason, that&#8217;s why I exist because if I can compile this stuff and make it palatable and easy to find for others, that&#8217;s what Dev Rel is, right? Like that&#8217;s what a lot of what we do is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like I&#8217;ll spend the time messing around with the Block Bindings API, and then I&#8217;ll do a live stream on it, where I&#8217;m like, okay, so we&#8217;re going to do this, and this is why I did it this way, and this is why you should do it this way because it&#8217;s easier, you know? And so like I can do all that busy work to help others who don&#8217;t, you know, because ain&#8217;t nobody got time to do all that, right? You know what I mean? So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:15] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s kind of a nice summation of where I was trying to get to. So let&#8217;s move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing which is going to be mentioned, well, who knows whether it&#8217;ll come up, maybe somebody will ask about it. But the questions basically the same. What is the Plugin Template Registration API? What would that be and why would you want to use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] Ryan Welcher: So the example that I have is that you&#8217;ve registered a custom post type that manages people. This is going to be a common theme throughout this. And you want to inject a single page template for that particular post type that&#8217;s curated, that isn&#8217;t part of the theme that&#8217;s being shipped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it allows you to add templates to the active theme from a plugin, from a WordPress plugin. Which is really, really, really handy. Because if you have a plugin that, you know, you have a jobs list plugin, you probably want to provide some default templates so you can just display all the custom fields and everything, and the person that&#8217;s installed your plugin just gets that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can just go to the single page for each job and they have a default template. It&#8217;s a fairly straight, it&#8217;s like one hook, or a filter, I think. So it&#8217;s fairly straightforward, but it&#8217;s super powerful, it&#8217;s like a quality of life thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:16] Nathan Wrigley: I wondered if it was something that developers had been clamoring for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] Ryan Welcher: I can remember like a year and a half ago spending half an afternoon figuring out, how can I do this? And it&#8217;s possible but, wow, is it ever in the weeds? So now it&#8217;s not. Now it&#8217;s like a filter that you just tell it where your template is and it shows up in your templates list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:33] Nathan Wrigley: Once again, we&#8217;ll put the links into the show notes. Okay, next one. Alright, Preview Options API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:41] Ryan Welcher: That&#8217;s a really big, fancy title for a new slot, for a slot fill. So in the preview panel where you can preview it as like a, you know, on mobile, desktop and tablet, there&#8217;s a slot that you can put something in there, and that&#8217;s kind of what it&#8217;s. So you can do whatever you want with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen an example where people were toggling light and dark mode. You could have it, I mean, whatever you can imagine, you can put it in there because it&#8217;s a, like a slot is sort of like a hook, like an action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:04] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, nice and straightforward. This one for me is probably the most interesting one. I don&#8217;t know why, I just find myself drawn to this one. And it&#8217;s not an API, we&#8217;re talking about data views. What is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] Ryan Welcher: The data views is wildly powerful. It&#8217;s a component, a component in the sense of like a JavaScript component. It&#8217;s what powers a lot of the views that you get in the site editors. So if you go into like your templates, or your pages was the first one, you can see it in a grid view, you can see it in a list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe the intention is that, as the site editor sort of spreads into other parts, you&#8217;ll see it being used for things like the post list view and stuff like that. So it&#8217;s a super powerful component. It&#8217;s being used in Gutenberg. I believe it&#8217;s still technically experimental because they&#8217;re still working on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:48] Nathan Wrigley: Feels like a nice one, that one, not just for developers who are building websites, but also for clients themselves, because they can suddenly, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re selling houses, real estate websites, something like that, and suddenly you&#8217;ve got this house, custom post type, something like that. And there&#8217;s this image and there&#8217;s a number of bedrooms and you can make it sortable and filterable. We want to drill into the houses that are between 150,000 and 300,000. We want to reverse the order, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the end user, the real estate agent will be able to do that. And so it&#8217;s going to make the whole project easier to understand, easier to maintain. So custom post types, pages, posts, users, that&#8217;s my understanding anyway. Is that done through a UI? Is that going to be done through a UI, or is that going to be something like opening up templates?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:37] Ryan Welcher: It&#8217;s a React component that you will provide the information. So right now it&#8217;s a little lower level I think, than they maybe want it to be because there&#8217;s a lot, I&#8217;m kind of just going off what I think rather than, like no one&#8217;s told me this. But having used it a little bit, there is definitely some API refinement that could be done, in the sense of like being able, because you have to provide literally everything for it to handle all of the actions for like sorting and all that stuff. And I think what they&#8217;re trying to do is make it a little bit easier to use. So you just give it data, as opposed to like having to define all the callbacks when you click a specific button and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:09] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;ll certainly make the UI, the admin area more, I don&#8217;t know, more feature rich. Hopefully this will bring it more into parity with all of those other platforms out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you, and again, this is not really something that you are talking about, but this was just something that occurred to me. The biggest visual change that I saw in WordPress 6.7 was zoom out, zoom out mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I just think the first time I, okay, I&#8217;ll explain. So let&#8217;s say you drop a pattern into a post or a page or something like that. Suddenly the whole thing kind of just zooms away. The page, the pattern is somehow distant. Everything shrinks almost like a mobile view, and it kind of just happens without you invoking it. And so that&#8217;s what that is, I think. What&#8217;s the point of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:55] Ryan Welcher: So you could get a sense of what you&#8217;ve just inserted in the overall size of the content. So like, if you&#8217;re writing really long pieces, my workshop website, I have very long content because it&#8217;s like a step-by-step, huge code blocks. For me to be able to insert something and get a sense of where it is on the page and look at it, that&#8217;s kind of what that&#8217;s for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:11] Nathan Wrigley: I have a fairly small laptop, and by the time that the left sidebar and the right sidebar and the block editor have all gone in there, by the time I&#8217;ve dropped a pattern in, there&#8217;s basically no real estate left on the screen for me to see what&#8217;s above it or below it. And this pulls it right out and gives you the impression of, well, there&#8217;s the whole blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although that sounds really trivial, if the branding and everything really matters and you want one thing to follow another, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s a landing page or something like that. It just gives you that overview and you can obviously move things around. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard to describe how profound it is. But it makes that editing experience, especially for novices, just so much more straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:50] Ryan Welcher: Oh, for sure, like, and if you drop a complicated pattern in the wrong spot, you&#8217;ll see that immediately. So yeah, it&#8217;s like a, I keep using the phrase quality of life, but it really is like a, oh, that&#8217;s just a nice touch. It&#8217;s made your life a little easier. And that&#8217;s kind of like, you know, I know there&#8217;s a lot of refinements going into the UI to make the writing experience better and easier, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:07] Nathan Wrigley: A little bit off piste, and I&#8217;m putting you on the spot here. If you had to pick one thing that&#8217;s coming that people may not know about, I mean, it doesn&#8217;t have to be something revolutionary, but just something that you are curious about that is going to drop soon. I don&#8217;t know, the next 6 or 12 months, something like that, that you think people will get something out of and enjoy and be excited about. I know that&#8217;s putting you on the spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:31] Ryan Welcher: I don&#8217;t have one thing per se. I&#8217;m super excited about the concept of bits. It&#8217;s a very complicated thing, but being able to define areas that you can edit in the editor. So for example, the example that probably makes the most sense without me showing, like using my hands because nobody can see me, is like when you have a block binding that is connected to a piece of post meta. That&#8217;s it. Let&#8217;s use the, whatever the byline aspect, you know? So it&#8217;s like a bio or something that&#8217;s connected in post meta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just want to edit one part of it, you can&#8217;t. You could edit the whole field, but you can&#8217;t edit just one section of it. Or if you have something like, my block developer cookbook site&#8217;s got a cooking time block that says, it&#8217;s got a little like cooking timer icon, and then it&#8217;s got 10, and then it says minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, well, the 10 part is actually the post meta. But I can&#8217;t edit that in line in the block editor because the whole output is, it&#8217;s like a span tag with some stuff, right? And so what bits would allow me to do is delineate that, I want to be able to edit just the 10, just that number. And that&#8217;ll be super, super powerful. It&#8217;s like an editable area inside of a larger editable area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:32] Nathan Wrigley: Oh yeah. And I can see that being powerful in a whole bunch of different ways. Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:37] Ryan Welcher: Yes. Yeah. And there&#8217;s obviously the Interactivity API, obviously, but it is one of the most exciting things that I&#8217;ve, I mean, it&#8217;s already out and there&#8217;s just more stuff coming and they&#8217;re just doing really, really cool things. I just love it. It is so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:50] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think, again, just kind of dropping you into it a little bit, do you think we&#8217;re at any risk of overcomplicating the amount of things that you can do in WordPress at the minute? Here&#8217;s an example. Let&#8217;s say I just took somebody off the street and said, here&#8217;s a brand new installed WordPress website. It allows you to make content, publish websites, off you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How realistic do you think it is with all the different bits and pieces that are dropping? I know you don&#8217;t have to get into the weeds of all this, but how easy do you think the UI is right now? Do you think it&#8217;s getting more complicated at the expense of, my question basically boils down to, are there too many options right now in the same UI, which make it difficult for people to understand who are new to the project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:30] Ryan Welcher: That&#8217;s an interesting question. WordPress has had a philosophy of decisions, not options for a long time. And I think Gutenberg is providing more options now, which is good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like, if I were to take my mother who&#8217;s not technical at all and sit her down and say, build a website, she would probably have a better chance of doing it with Gutenberg than she would&#8217;ve pre 5.0, because she can control every part of it. I mean, I&#8217;d have to tell her how to do it all because she&#8217;s not technical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that there is a lot of options, but there&#8217;s also a lot of potential for creativity. And you have access to almost everything that you would need in the editor experience now, whereas you didn&#8217;t before. If you wanted to build a very customised theme, like in classic, and this isn&#8217;t like taking a shot at classic, but if you wanted to have a person post type, you couldn&#8217;t do that. You needed to edit code to be able to output that meta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I&#8217;m sure there were plugins and stuff, but now you don&#8217;t really need to do that. You have everything that you need as long as you know where to click to find it. But it&#8217;s like, anybody who&#8217;s never used WordPress would have to figure that out in any platform. You&#8217;d have to sort that out. I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of options, which can be confusing, but now you can do whatever you want to do, for the most part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:38] Nathan Wrigley: I think it&#8217;s curious because for the longest time people have been sort of saying, you know, the sky&#8217;s falling in, the job market for WordPress developers is just going to get hollowed out because the UI, you know, the ability to do things, a novice being able to do things, it&#8217;s difficult. We should make it more straightforward. There&#8217;s going to be no left work for, I don&#8217;t know, freelancers, implementers, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case. I think all of these options are getting put in and some of the things that we talked about, you know, the Interactivity API and all of that, that&#8217;s the technical stuff. So there&#8217;s all of these new possibilities that are getting created, but it&#8217;s not going to be, it&#8217;s not probably going to be in the boundaries, at the beginning anyway, of a complete novice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s creating new workflows for developers to push what&#8217;s possible inside of a WordPress website, and kind of maintaining the job market for people who are implementing already. But hopefully that fear will go away because of all these different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:32] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s kind of like the way a lot of developers are looking at AI right now. People are terrified AI&#8217;s going to take over. It&#8217;s not, you&#8217;re just going going to have to learn to use AI to get the job done. You still need to have the skillset to tell it what you need to do, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the same with all this. Like, so the interactivity API, it&#8217;s really cool, and it&#8217;s ripe for someone to write a library of interactions with a UI. So the implementers who don&#8217;t maybe write that level of JavaScript, or any JavaScript, can just install that plugin. And now they can make their animations, and it&#8217;s like an animation library that&#8217;s got a UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s just going to open up other opportunities for the people writing code and building plugins and things like that. I mean, I think with change, change is hard. People fear change, right? It&#8217;s figuring out what the new opportunities are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:16] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, let&#8217;s just talk about AI for just a minute. I really don&#8217;t want to get too much into AI because I&#8217;m coming from a real point of ignorance. But like you said, there&#8217;s a ton of information, misinformation. I don&#8217;t know what the right word is, that AI is basically going to be able to make it possible for anybody to speak a sentence and have a website. Give me a website, I want to read all about cars. And you just go off and it&#8217;ll come up with a website for that particular purpose. Is WordPress aligning itself to be useful with AI, do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:47] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, I think so. I mean, AI is the new hotness, right? And it&#8217;s getting less and less expensive to do the AI stuff, you know, the LLMs and all that stuff. And it&#8217;s getting better, and it&#8217;s only going to get better and smarter and faster. I think that there&#8217;s, again, it&#8217;s just going to change what you have to do as a developer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am behind on AI, but I&#8217;ve made a concerted effort to start using Cursor AI, which I think is a lot of fun. I&#8217;m finding that like, I still have to be a developer to tell it what I want, right? But you can absolutely say, hey, build me a website that sells cars. And it&#8217;ll build you a website that sells cars. Who knows what the code looks like, and if you can maintain it, and if there&#8217;s a bug in there, can you find it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think there&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure there are people listening that are like, oh, you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. You can already do that in AI and it&#8217;s amazing. Because I&#8217;m just not, it&#8217;s like the running joke, in JavaScript it&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s a new library released every other weekend. I feel like there&#8217;s a new AI tool that&#8217;s like better and better and better like at every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] Nathan Wrigley: I am finding it fascinating that a lot of people who are putting out content into the WordPress space, videos and things like that, they&#8217;re making a concerted effort to bind AI into WordPress. It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;ve just pivoted completely to, let&#8217;s build websites with AI. It&#8217;s more, let&#8217;s find a thing in WordPress that we can do in a heartbeat, and we actually want to do it inside of WordPress, and let&#8217;s just add a piece of AI on top of that to enable me to do this curious thing, and solve this problem that I&#8217;ve got with a client website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it seems like people are using AI just to build stuff on top of WordPress, and not really the opposite. I haven&#8217;t seen any sort of move away. I don&#8217;t need WordPress anymore. That just doesn&#8217;t seem to be what I&#8217;m seeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:22] Ryan Welcher: And I think it&#8217;s because the people that are doing that are, that&#8217;s where they work is in WordPress, right? Like, if you&#8217;re using, I don&#8217;t know, Wix or whatever, or like Next.js or any sort of like other platform for web stuff, I think you would see people trying to apply these AI things to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s a huge opportunity for an AI to be able to create block patterns and create templates that work properly. It&#8217;s hard to do right now because I don&#8217;t think the LLMs really have the information for it. Like, it&#8217;s not because of the way that the data&#8217;s stored, it&#8217;s sort of different than, like it&#8217;s not really that well documented, maybe. I may not be making sense right now. There&#8217;s no real like example, right? Because it&#8217;s sort of different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:58] Nathan Wrigley: We need you to create more examples, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:02] Ryan Welcher: I think what&#8217;s really exciting is that having to be in an, like an encyclopedia of APIs, having to like to the documentation site all the time, I think that&#8217;s going to go away. It&#8217;s already going away. Things like GitHub Copilot and these intergrated AI tools in IDEs and everything. Now you can just be like, write me a plugin that does this. Or like, what&#8217;s the parameter name that I need for WP Query to be able to do a taxonomy query, right? It&#8217;ll just tell you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can just do that. Let it do its thing while you&#8217;re working on other things. And I think the days of like Stack Overflow, you know what I mean? That&#8217;s like, you Google the problem and the first example, and most upvoted answer, gets copied and pasted, right? I think that&#8217;s going to, maybe not replace, but the new Stack Overflow is like these AI tools that you can ask questions on, how do I do this? I don&#8217;t know, I think it&#8217;s just changing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:45] Nathan Wrigley: I think it&#8217;s a really interesting time and it doesn&#8217;t make me feel I&#8217;m nervous. I&#8217;m more sanguine about it, in all honesty. Yeah, maybe a year ago I was kind of assuming a bit like the sky was going to fall in, but it really does appear that people who are making interesting things in the AI WordPress space are just finding curious holes, yeah. And filling them up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so Jamie Marsland did something the other day where he put a video together where he created a little iPhone app where he could upload images and click a button and it was able to do what Jamie wanted. And I think the same will be true, you know, for clients that will come to you. I&#8217;ve got this unique problem. Maybe that would&#8217;ve taken a week of developer time in the past. Maybe now it will be able to be done in a heartbeat, in more like an hour or a couple of hours or something like that. So it makes the possibilities for real bespoke websites much more possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:33] Ryan Welcher: Yeah. And like hobbyists, kids who want to get into coding, that&#8217;s fantastic. You can just say, I want to build a website for my dog, and then all of a sudden they&#8217;re like learning by osmosis how coding works and that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of times that I&#8217;ve talked to a developer, and I&#8217;ve done this myself, where I&#8217;ve built a little like one-off thing, like my wife likes to track, she&#8217;s really into gut health. So like all the different like vegetables and stuff, you know, this like little point system. So I built a, just a like a really simple little app for it. It was like a weekend project. I probably could&#8217;ve done it in like half an hour in AI, and like that would&#8217;ve been nice. And it&#8217;s, you know, she doesn&#8217;t care about the features. She doesn&#8217;t care about what the code looks like. She just wants this thing that she can track information on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:13] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I think that&#8217;s going to be the curious thing. The thing that probably would&#8217;ve been a real cost benefit analysis in the past. They&#8217;re going to take, you know, something along the lines of that it would take three to six developers, six weeks to pull it off. Whereas now it&#8217;ll be, it&#8217;s going to take two developers an afternoon to pull it off. I mean, it might be that things need tidying up, but it just suddenly makes the possibilities, I don&#8217;t know, much more possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:38] Ryan Welcher: For sure. Like, there&#8217;s a classic joke about like unit tests in code. Like, ain&#8217;t nobody got time for unit tests, because once you&#8217;ve written the code, you&#8217;re never going to go back and write those tests. What if you told an AI, hey, go write all my unit tests for this code base. And even if it gets some of it wrong, you&#8217;re still going to get, you know, it&#8217;s going to save a lot of time, it&#8217;s going to do a lot of that busy work for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mean, I&#8217;ve never tested that. It would be really interesting to see, if we pointed it to like the WordPress repo, which has got, I don&#8217;t know what the percentage of test coverage is, but it just said, cover everything else in tests and see what happens. That&#8217;d be super fun. Who knows if it&#8217;d work, but yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:11] Nathan Wrigley: I think it&#8217;s a really exciting time in WordPress. I think there&#8217;s so much going on. You&#8217;ve just described a whole ton of it over the past 40 minutes or so. Yeah, it&#8217;s really, genuinely feels like there&#8217;s a lot of scope for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, whether the number goes up from 43 or stagnates kind of isn&#8217;t really what interests me. It&#8217;s more what&#8217;s possible, and the kind of crowd that you are going to be speaking to this week are the very, very audience that are going to make this stuff possible into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So good luck and thank you. And I hope that the presentation goes well, and I pray that the internet holds up for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:43] Ryan Welcher: It&#8217;ll be a very one-sided, vote free presentation. So hopefully, hopefully they get it sorted out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:50] Nathan Wrigley: Ryan Welcher, thank you so much for spending time with me today. It was really interesting. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:55] Ryan Welcher: Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanWelcherCodes\">Ryan Welcher</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan is a Developer Advocate sponsored by Automattic.

He shares his journey from admiring the “platform evangelists” of the Flash era to finding his own dream job helping developers understand and implement the newest technologies in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about some of the biggest recent updates to WordPress Core, including the Block Bindings API, Plugin Template Registration API, Preview Options API, and the new Data Views. Ryan breaks down what these new tools are, why they matter, and how they’re making WordPress block development both more powerful and more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also discusses the growing emphasis on intentional, high-quality documentation and resources over the past few years, and how many teams are working to make life easier for developers of all skill levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the balance between the increasing flexibility of WordPress’s UI and the risk of overwhelming new users, as well as exploring how emerging technologies like AI are shaping the future for WordPress developers and hobbyists alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in what’s new in WordPress development, want to understand where the project is heading, or are curious about the real impact of recent changes and features, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan&#8217;s session at WordCamp Asia: <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/session/the-block-developer-cookbook-wc-asia-2025-edition/\">The Block Developer Cookbook: WC Asia 2025 Edition</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-bindings/\">Block Bindings API</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/\">Interactivity API</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress Developer News</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\">Block Editor Handbook</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ryanwelchercodes\">RyanWelcherCodes</a> on Twitch</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanWelcherCodes\">RyanWelcherCodes</a> on YouTube</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\">Gutenberg on GitHub</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/20/new-plugin-template-registration-api-in-wordpress-6-7/\">Plugin Template Registration API</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/settings/options-api/\">Preview Options API</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor AI</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: Breaking Language Barriers: The Journey of Translating WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=94712\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/breaking-language-barriers-the-journey-of-translating-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:226:\"The web connects diverse communities, yet language barriers persist.

With this plugin activated, content creators can easily mark inline citations using the <code>q</code> HTML element right from the Format toolbar in the block editor. This way they make sure that assistive technologies get that the sentence is a citation, keeping things clear for everyone!  Using this plugin keeps your site inline with one of the European Accessibility Act&#8217;s (EAA) criteria to properly indicate inline citations, according to Audras. To style the inline quote use the <strong>Editor &gt; Styles &gt; Additional CSS</strong> and add CSS for the element q, i.e., <code>q {color:purple}</code>. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest video, <strong>Jamie Marsland</strong> shows you <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH3RINZ8rWI\">how to create beautiful Stacking Cards in WordPress</a></strong>. &#8220;You’ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the process so you can understand how it works and tweak it for your own needs.&#8221; he wrote in the description. </p>\n\n\n<div width=\"100%\" class=\"wp-block-newsletterglue-showhide ng-block\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2025&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test, and Meta team from Jan. 2024 on.

He explores how attributes work within WordPress blocks, focusing on their role in storing and managing block data. Garrido explains the different types of attributes, such as string, number, array, and object, and demonstrates how to define them in a block’s code. The article also covers how attributes are sourced from HTML, how they persist in the block’s markup, and how developers can use them to control block behavior and appearance. Practical code examples illustrate best practices for defining, accessing, and updating attributes in custom Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Riad Benguella</strong> announced new features for Studio app. <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/03/31/studio-custom-domains-https/\"><strong>Add Custom Domains and HTTPS Support to Your Local WordPress Development</strong>.</a> User can now make local WordPress development more closely mirror live production environments.

It helps developer with better testing of plugins and themes that require specific domains or secure connections. The process is streamlined, with Studio handling most technical details automatically, though macOS users must manually install the SSL certificate.

This staggering statistic highlights a common frustration for professionals – traditional business cards often fail to create lasting connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital business cards offer a smarter approach to networking. Unlike paper cards that get lost or discarded, these modern alternatives let you share contact details instantly through QR codes and track when recipients view your information. Plus, many digital cards integrate with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, transforming simple contact sharing into a powerful lead generation tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the best digital business card options available so you can decide on the tools that will enhance your <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">personal brand</a>, help you build stronger professional relationships, or generate more leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why digital business cards are your new lead generation engine</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember when business cards were just pieces of paper with your name and phone number? Those days are gone. Modern digital business cards work more like miniature marketing systems – they don&#8217;t just <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/08/02/organizational-benefits-of-efficient-contact-sharing/\">share your contact info</a>; they help you build and nurture professional relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The growth in digital business card adoption tells an interesting story. According to recent research, the <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/04/17/2647635/0/en/Digital-Business-Card-Market-Size-is-Estimated-to-Hit-US-500-Million-by-2033-North-America-Leads-the-Industry-Share-Fact-MR-Report.html#:~:text=Worldwide%20demand%20for%20digital%20business%20cards%20is%20forecasted%20to%20surge%20at%20a%20CAGR%20of%209.5%25%20during%20the%20forecast%20period%20(2023%20to%202033).\">worldwide demand for digital business cards is forecasted to surge</a> at a rate of 9.5% during the forecast period (2023 to 2033). And it makes sense – who wouldn&#8217;t want a business card that automatically saves contacts and helps track potential leads?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like having a tiny personal assistant in your pocket. When you share your digital card via QR code, it transfers contact details and automatically logs the interaction in your CRM system. Some cards even notify you when someone views your profile or downloads your materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tracking capability transforms how you follow up with contacts. Instead of playing the guessing game of &#8220;Should I reach out now?&#8221;, you can actively see who&#8217;s actively engaged with your profile and time your follow-ups perfectly. Spot a potential client who just viewed your portfolio? That&#8217;s your cue to send a friendly check-in message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tools come at various price points and with different features. Some focus on simple contact sharing, while others offer full suites of lead generation and analytics tools. For example, a sales team might want advanced CRM integration and tracking, while a freelance designer might just need basic contact sharing with a portfolio link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore some specific options and find out which might work best for your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Guide to the top digital business card platforms&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

Popl</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1351\" height=\"749\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/popl-homepage.png\" alt=\"Popl homepage\" class=\"wp-image-3068\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://popl.co/\">Popl</a> is an AI-powered digital business card platform with a focus on lead capture and event networking.

Wave</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/wave-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Wave homepage\" class=\"wp-image-3069\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wavecnct.com\">Wave</a> combines digital business card functionality with lead generation tools.

Mobilo&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mobilo-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Mobilo homepage\" class=\"wp-image-3070\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mobilocard.com/\">Mobilo</a> positions itself as a business card solution designed specifically for professional teams, with an emphasis on personal branding and event networking. The platform treats each digital card as a mini landing page, allowing extensive customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform includes several team-focused features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Customizable headers, video embeds, and downloadable content hosting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Event-focused lead capture with automated follow-ups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integration with email systems for automated presentation sharing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Built-in calendar linking capabilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detailed ROI tracking for events and networking activities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The pricing structure is flexible and based on several factors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Card material choice (recyclable plastic, wood, or stainless steel).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of team members.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Required features and integrations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Physical NFC card requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Worth noting: </strong>For specific pricing details and customized team solutions, interested users should visit <a href=\"https://www.mobilocard.com/pricing\">Mobilo&#8217;s pricing page</a>, as costs vary based on organizational needs and setup requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gravatar: Your universal digital identity solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar takes a unique double approach to digital business cards – it integrates them automatically into the platforms professionals use daily and can serve offline networking with a dynamic QR code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply add your Gravatar profile to Apple or Google Wallet for instant QR code sharing at events and meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gravatar-qr-code-example.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a Gravatar profile QR code\" class=\"wp-image-3071\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike standalone solutions that mostly require manual sharing, your Gravatar profile appears naturally wherever you engage online – from WordPress blogs to <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> repositories, <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a> channels, and <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\">Atlassian</a> products.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1328\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/update-once-sync-everywhere-1.png\" alt=\"Gravatar profile syncing capabilities\" class=\"wp-image-3072\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as a self-maintaining digital business card. Update your Gravatar profile once, and those changes ripple across every platform where your email address appears. No more checking multiple profiles or worrying about outdated information. This works great for offline networking as well. When someone scans your QR code, they will be led to your profile, which is always up-to-date, unlike normal business cards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For professionals managing multiple identities, Gravatar&#8217;s email-based system lets you maintain separate profiles – use one email for work-related platforms and another for personal projects. This separation ensures you present the right image in each context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the true power of Gravatar lies in its organic reach. Rather than only actively exchanging contact information, potential connections discover your profile naturally as they interact with your comments, contributions, or collaborations across the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gravatar-comment-section-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Example of a Gravatar profile showing automatically in a WordPress blog comment section\" class=\"wp-image-3073\" />\n\n\n\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f913.png\" alt=\"🤓\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><strong>Tip:</strong> <em>Add your Gravatar URL to your </em><a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/12/20/link-in-bio-tools/\"><em>social media bio links</em></a><em> to further expand this passive networking effect.</em></td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create your digital business card with Gravatar today</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Platforms like HiHello, Popl, Wave, and Mobilo offer solid digital business card features, but Gravatar stands apart with its unique integration-first approach. Unlike these services that require manual sharing or paid subscriptions for advanced features, Gravatar provides comprehensive functionality completely free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Gravatar different? While other platforms focus on lead generation through active networking, Gravatar also creates opportunities passively through automatic integration into the tools professionals already use. Your profile appears organically across WordPress, GitHub, Slack, and other major platforms – no subscription fees or manual updates are required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of Gravatar as your central command center for online identity. Update it once, and your information automatically syncs everywhere your email appears. No juggling multiple profiles or paying for team features.

And although this seminar was about physical clutter, it got me thinking about job searching and my résumé. I&#8217;m not gonna lie &#8211; although I help other people all the time with their CVs and résumés &#8211; my CV is a cluttered mess. And it needs desperate attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as I work on mine, I&#8217;m going to share some tips that might help others as they hone their résumés, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-decide-between-a-resume-and-a-cv-curriculum-vitae\">Decide between a résumé and a CV (curriculum vitae)</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>A resume focuses on your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thehrdigest.com/job-skills-to-include-on-your-resume-with-examples/\">job history and skills</a>, whereas a CV emphasizes your personal accomplishments. Both documents are essential, but they serve different purposes. Your resume is designed to get you noticed for a specific type of position where you can apply your skills as an entry-level sales job. In contrast, a CV shows employers and recruiters details about your life outside of work, such as previous volunteer activities and sports teams.<br /><em>from <a href=\"https://www.thehrdigest.com/cv-vs-resume-the-difference-between-a-resume-and-a-curriculum-vitae/\">TheHRDigest.com</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us in tech will want to use a résumé rather than a CV, although a hybrid may be considered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I still want to include a list of professional speaking engagements where I have been on stage. For a marketing and community position this is important, although not usually included in a traditional résumé.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-functional-resume-vs-chronological-resume\">Functional résumé vs. chronological résumé</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A functional résumé and a chronological résumé serve different purposes depending on you background and career goals. A functional résumé emphasizes skills and competencies rather than work history, making it ideal for individuals with gaps in employment, career changers, or those with diverse but non-linear experiences. It groups qualifications under skill categories, helping highlight what you, the candidate, can do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, a chronological résumé lists work experience in reverse chronological order, showcasing a clear employment timeline and career progression. This format is usually favored by most employers and is best suited for candidates with a steady, relevant work history in the same field. While the functional résumé focuses on what you <em>can</em> do, the chronological résumé highlights <em>where</em> and <em>when</em> you’ve done it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might choose a functional résumé over a chronological one if you want to shift the focus away from your work history and emphasize your skills and achievements instead. By organizing your résumé around what you <em>can do</em> rather than when and where you did it, a functional format allows you to present yourself in a stronger light if your job history doesn&#8217;t tell the full story of your qualifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-to-show-your-age-or-not-to\">To show your age or not to?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, you should not include your age on a résumé. Age is considered personal information and isn&#8217;t relevant to your qualifications or ability to perform a job. Including it can unintentionally open the door to age discrimination, whether you&#8217;re younger or older. Instead, focus on your skills, experience, and accomplishments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means you should avoid including graduation dates if you&#8217;re concerned about age bias—what matters most to employers is <em>what you bring to the table</em>, not how old you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-should-you-list-out-hobbies\">Should you list out hobbies?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Listing hobbies on a résumé is optional and depends on the job you&#8217;re applying for. In general, you should only include hobbies if they are relevant to the position or help show skills that are transferable or desirable in the workplace—like leadership, creativity, teamwork, or dedication. For example, if you&#8217;re applying for a job in marketing, a hobby like managing a personal blog or creating social media content could be a plus. On the other hand, if your hobbies aren’t related to the job or don’t add value to your application, it&#8217;s best to leave them off and use the space for more impactful content like achievements or skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listing some hobbies can share more information that you may want to. For example, listing something like being a scout leader might share that you have parenting responsibilities, which may make you seem less desirable (especially for women), as unconscious biases expect mothers to spend more time with family than at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-should-you-show-in-your-tech-stack\">What should you show in your tech stack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many times I have seen people list tech that is too basic to include on their résumé for the job they&#8217;re seeking. Including things like email, Google sheets, and Slack in today&#8217;s market are already expected of applicants and appear as résumé padding. When you list your tech stack on your résumé, take a careful look at each on your list to evaluate if it needs to be there. When in doubt, ask a friend in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-about-a-portfolio\">How about a portfolio?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For someone in the technology industry, a strong portfolio should showcase both technical skills and the impact of your work. Here’s what to include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Projects</strong> – Highlight 3–5 of your best or most relevant projects. Include brief descriptions, your role, the technologies used, and outcomes or results (e.g., improved performance, user growth, bug fixes, etc.).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For developers, include <strong>Code Samples</strong> – Share links to GitHub or similar platforms where employers can see clean, well-documented code. Make sure it&#8217;s organized and shows your understanding of best practices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Case Studies</strong> – For more complex projects, write short case studies that outline the problem, your approach, tools used, and the result.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Technical Skills</strong> – For developers, clearly list programming languages, frameworks, tools, and platforms you’re proficient in. For marketers, list the technology skills you have in media production and scheduling.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Live Demos or Screenshots</strong> – If possible, provide links to live demos or include screenshots to make your work tangible—especially helpful for front-end or UX/UI roles and marketing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resume &amp; Contact Info</strong> – Include a downloadable résumé and a clear way for potential employers to contact you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Certifications or Awards</strong> – Optional, but helpful if they’re relevant to the job (like AWS certification, hackathon wins, etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to show not just what you can build, but how you think, collaborate, and solve problems—that&#8217;s what really stands out. Want help building or reviewing a portfolio?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-should-you-include-a-photo-on-your-resume\">Should you include a photo on your résumé?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While your photo is included in your social channels (including LinkedIn), it&#8217;s not necessary to include on a résumé, and may actually count against you if the reviewer has any conscious or unconscious biases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-in-doubt-hire-help-for-your-resume\">When in doubt, hire help for your résumé</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding your next job is important, so if you&#8217;re not confident in your résumé-building skills, spending some money up front to stand out in a sea of applicants is money well-spent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-best-wishes\">Best wishes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of all, best wishes in your pursuit of your next great position. Wishing you an easy time and a great fit for the best salary. Your happiness and health deserve it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Find jobs to apply for on our <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/jobs/\">Job Board</a>.</p>\n<p>This article, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/decluttering-your-resume/\">Decluttering Your Résumé</a>, was published at  <a href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status</a> — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Apr 2025 21:30:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Michelle Frechette\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Post Status: Agency News Weekly\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=163506\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://poststatus.com/agency-news-weekly-2025-04-14/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5858:\"<h2 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-3f9efd72 gb-headline-text\">It&#8217;s Official &#8211; Only One Major WordPress Release for 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>WordPress 6.8 will be the only major core release this year following <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/04/04/dotorg-core-committers-check-in/\">a meeting of Core Committers</a> on April 4.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The stated reason for the decision was a reduction in weekly core contribution hours by companies like Automattic (from 4000 to 16) and Newfold Digital (from 329 to 20).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.therepository.email/wordpress-scales-back-to-one-major-release-in-2025\">The Repository&#8217;s story on this topic</a> brings excellent insight to some of the people and opinions associated with this decision.

Unlike traditional WordCamps, Color Code aims to be more inclusive, welcoming participants from various platforms and technologies. The event will feature a diverse lineup of speakers, interactive elements like a live graffiti art competition, and networking opportunities. Set to take place in Buffalo, New York, the conference emphasizes accessibility and community involvement, promising a dynamic and engaging experience for all attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-top-takeaways\">Top Takeaways: </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Networking and Collaboration Opportunities: </strong>The Color Code event emphasizes the power of in-person connections. With a focus on creative professionals, marketers, and developers, the event is designed to facilitate collaboration through both formal presentations and informal networking (the &#8220;hallway track&#8221;). Attendees can expect meaningful conversations and potential partnerships that might not happen in a purely virtual setting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Diverse and Relevant Topics: </strong>The event will cover a range of cutting-edge topics, such as AI, content strategies, and the challenges of decoupling from major tech players like Google. These presentations, led by volunteer speakers, aim to provide valuable insights and practical knowledge, making the event a great opportunity for professionals to stay informed on industry trends.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Affordability and Accessibility:</strong> With an affordable ticket price ($40), including lunch and the after-party, Color Code positions itself as an accessible event for professionals of all backgrounds. The organizers also plan to record sessions and make them available online, ensuring that those who can’t attend in person still have access to the valuable content.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\">Mentioned In The Show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://colorcode.events/\">Color Code</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://pressconf.events/\">Press Conf</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wpengine.com/\">WP Engine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://senecaonebuffalo.com/\">Seneca One Tower</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://douglasdevelopment.com/\">Douglas Development</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://luminus.agency/\">Luminous </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.genemccarthys.com/\">Gene McCarthy&#8217;s</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/a2-hosting\">A2 Hosting</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.

Today I&#8217;m joined by two thirds of the organizing team for Color Code Events, Tim Bouchard and Ron Brennan, my neighbors to the west in Buffalo, New York. How are you guys doing?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TIm Bouchard: Good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:00:18&nbsp; Good. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:20&nbsp; I&#8217;m good. Thanks. Ron, I don&#8217;t remember when you and I met. It&#8217;s been a really long time because we&#8217;ve been doing Buffalo, and it&#8217;s probably 2015 or 16. If I&#8217;m 14? I don&#8217;t know, being honest. We go way back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:00:31&nbsp; 14 or 15 Yep. Somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:33&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:00:33&nbsp; Your first WordCamp event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:36&nbsp; It was. I joke about I joke, I laugh about the fact that I posted on my only social channel at the time, which was, Facebook, and I called it. I said I was at my first WordPress Camp because I didn&#8217;t even remember. They were called word camps back then, but and Tim, you and I go back probably almost as far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time Bouchard: Almost yeah.&nbsp; I met you back in 16 maybe?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:55&nbsp; So nice to see you both here today, but we&#8217;re here to talk about Color Code, which I am fortunate to be a speaker at. I&#8217;m excited to bring my, my story there, my talk about doing personal branding and how you can increase your personal branding, and there&#8217;s some basic steps to doing that and get started. It can feel overwhelming, but it doesn&#8217;t need to. So I&#8217;ll save that for the actual event. I won&#8217;t give it all the way today, but I wanted to talk to you guys about what you&#8217;re doing because it&#8217;s it&#8217;s WordPress adjacent. It&#8217;s not a WordCamp. You&#8217;re doing something on your own. Similar to Press Conf that&#8217;s going on at the end of this month, but you have managed to keep the costs down. So it&#8217;s still a fairly low investment for people to attend. And it&#8217;s not an official WordPress event, which also was a choice for you. And it&#8217;s in person as well. So it&#8217;s not an online event.&nbsp; So tell me all the thought processes that went into getting this up and going off the ground. Also, I think the venue is supposed to be pretty sensational from what I&#8217;ve heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:02:03&nbsp; Yeah. For sure.Yeah. Ron, do you want to start with this? I mean, you have the bigger history, so you can go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:02:08&nbsp; Yeah. So as you know, like, Ben and myself and then Andy and then Tim, you know, we kind of ran the WordPress community here in Buffalo, New York. Ran the WordCamps we started this year. You know, Michelle, you know how we do it. We&#8217;re last minute. It drives you crazy. But, you know, we kind of pull together. We decide three weeks before the event. Hey, let&#8217;s do a WordCamp. And then, you know, our handlers and everything are going crazy. This year Tim really got involved, and he&#8217;s like, you know what, guys? We&#8217;re going to do this right this year.&nbsp; It&#8217;s going to be a real, you know, event that people look forward to going to. But we got to start. I mean we started last year after the event. It was crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:02:51&nbsp; Yeah. July and August. We started planning meeting for this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:02:53&nbsp; Tim, you accomplished what I was unable to do for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard: I’m very persuasive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:02:57 Light that fire under those guys and get them started earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:02&nbsp; Yeah. He, you know, he got us motivated by always suggesting meeting places that had, like, beer and chicken wings. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:09&nbsp; I mean, with Buffalo. You got it. Where&#8217;s your favorite wings from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:15&nbsp; Favorite wings. Mine are probably Bar Bill, but I like Gene McCarthy&#8217;s a lot, too. And that&#8217;s where this kind of all originated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:03:23&nbsp; I like Gene McCarthy&#8217;s too, but my my secret is the Tonawanda Golf Dome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:28&nbsp; Oh, those are good, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:30&nbsp; And you guys introduced me to Elmo&#8217;s, and I really liked Elmo&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:03:33&nbsp; Yeah. So Elmo&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:03:35&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:35&nbsp; Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:35&nbsp; We got sidetracked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:37&nbsp; Sorry. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:03:38&nbsp; That&#8217;s alright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:38&nbsp; Do we have a time limit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:40&nbsp; I mean, we try to keep it to an hour, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:03:42&nbsp; Okay. So, anyway, we so we got started. We got going with our, our handler, sponsor, whoever, you know, our organizing friend. And then we got into it, and all the stuff happened with WordPress, you know, and it was really around that time with like Check Box Gate. Remember that? Like, I don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s still a thing where you got to certify that you&#8217;re not affiliated with WP engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:04:06&nbsp; It&#8217;s like pineapple now or something. Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s not a thing anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:04:10&nbsp; And we, you know, Tim and I both run our agencies and use those, those services. So we&#8217;re like, we don&#8217;t even know if we can log into this thing. And then, you know, are we going to be hindered by people that utilize this, that won&#8217;t you can&#8217;t buy tickets unless you check that box and log in to the WordPress back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:04:30&nbsp; So there were a lot of unknowns. But beside all of that, we we kind of started having conversations adjacent to this anyway, and thinking it would be cool to have a conference that wasn&#8217;t so platform specific and that didn&#8217;t, you know, like, WordPress is cool and designers come, but they have to be familiar with WordPress. This thing allows any platform, any technology, any designer, marketing agencies, you know, whatever. We&#8217;ve got so many different various people that would never probably come to a WordCamp, because maybe they don&#8217;t build on. We got a guy that&#8217;s building a CMS, I think, in one of the talks. I believe so. So nothing against WordCamp, you know, we we hope to keep that going here in the Buffalo community. But we, you know, we still have our WordCamp Meetup group that that goes once a month. But this is an exciting opportunity to do something different. And we didn&#8217;t know how it was going to be received. But, you know, Tim, again, got the, you know, just started like, emailing everybody and, and it&#8217;s like, okay, well, I guess we&#8217;re doing this thing. So, you know, formed a, an organization and started putting it together. And it&#8217;s going to be a great event. So Tim can talk about, like, the venue and all of that fun stuff that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:54&nbsp; I also want to know where the name came from. So I want you to dive into that at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:05:58&nbsp; To sort of the real story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:05:59&nbsp; Yeah, yeah. Color Code itself is. I think the idea was we wanted to lean into both sides of the equation. And you know how it goes when you brainstorm like this. We had a ton of terrible ideas. We had some that other people already taken. We had some that were just straight up silly, but the Color Code, color art design, code tech, and it just kind of it&#8217;s, you know, alliteration, it all kind of works. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:25&nbsp; It sounds like a Dunkle thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:06:29&nbsp; He was part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:06:30&nbsp; Yeah. He&#8217;s part. Yeah, we all definitely thought it&#8217;s one of those things where, like, the Slack channel and the Google Drive doc just goes crazy for like, two weeks, and then ultimately, you end up, okay. There&#8217;s a domain we could use for that. Let&#8217;s go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:06:42&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it came down to the domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:06:44&nbsp; Yeah, I think this is what everything comes down to when you name stuff. Now it&#8217;s is there a domain that you can register for it and then get an LLC or whatever. So Color Code was really meant to one have like a fun sound and really specifically just plainly say this is design and tech. And when you think about like the marketing world, that kind of factors into everything that we do for marketing too. So it&#8217;s all encompassing. And to John&#8217;s point or sorry, Ron&#8217;s point. It really allows us to branch out topic wise and technology wise. And we were talking about the venue, the Seneca One Tower in Buffalo is the most impressive building in the city from a size standpoint that stands over the city at like 33 floors or something like that. I&#8217;d say that City Hall is still probably the most impressive building, but the tower is amazing, but it&#8217;s also home to 43 North, which is one of the largest startup incubators in the country and runs one of the largest competitions in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:07:41&nbsp; So there&#8217;s lots of startups there, and they all have marketing, tech, advanced, you know, promotion. So it really kind of fits the vibe of what that tower has tried to become under Douglas Development, which is sort of like a tech hub and an incubator hub. And MIT has invested in it for. Their, their tech department. So it it has a a great auditorium large breakout rooms for. And we planned on maybe having one good track, but we got so many speakers submissions and there were a lot of good talks. And we really did want to have a variety of topics, from design to development to marketing. And it ultimately ended up that we we had enough, to whittle it down, to whittle it down to three tracks, which was 20 speakers and 19 talks. We have one. The headline talk, is actually a two person talk in the auditorium at the end of the day, but, it really worked out. Well, we do have we have speakers coming from all over the East Coast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:08:43&nbsp; We got sponsors at the national level. And to to Ron&#8217;s point, by making the event a little bit more inclusive to marketing and creative. We were able to pull a lot of local agency support to you on the sponsor side, because one of the goals was, we don&#8217;t need this to be a conference that makes money. We all have jobs. We all have agencies or freelance gigs. We wanted to create something that was still accessible for students and startup people, or just hobbyists even. So by getting the sponsorship, it allowed us to keep down the ticket costs. So the tickets are around what a typical WordCamp would be as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:09:25&nbsp; Nice. That makes it much, much more accessible for people, for sure. Especially when you do have people flying in from all over to attend and to speak there. I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:09:35&nbsp; Yeah. And it is still volunteer speaking at this point too. I mean, there&#8217;s a few sponsors that have speaking spots because it&#8217;s part of their sponsor level. But, the challenge to having a low ticket event is it has to be very community driven. So in that aspect, it is a lot like WordCamp. It&#8217;s just that the speakers are coming from such more diverse backgrounds now, and diverse topics, that it&#8217;s just interesting to see that there are other people in these industries that are willing to do volunteer speaking, too. So yeah, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s one. The other way, to their credit, to the speaker&#8217;s credit of being able to keep tickets, down in cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:10:13&nbsp; Yeah. I&#8217;m going to pull up the, the site so we can kind of talk a little bit through, first of all, who is the Bauhaus lover? Because the whole design seems very much in the Bauhaus arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:10:27&nbsp; Yeah. Which that&#8217;s my my art director at Luminous, John English. This is his brainchild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:10:32&nbsp; I love it. It looks great. And, there&#8217;s downtown Buffalo, I recognize that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:10:37&nbsp; Yep. That that view right there is up main Street from the level that the event is going to be on at Seneca Tower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:10:44&nbsp; Oh, nice. My daughter used to live right on Main Street there. So, Let&#8217;s see. So you have right now we are in the standard, so it&#8217;s only $40 to attend. And if you sign up after the 20th, it&#8217;s only $50. And you can do that with or without a t shirt for that extra $10. I see wings, of course. You gotta have wings. The venue looks phenomenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:11:08&nbsp; Yep that the tower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:11:08&nbsp; And then there&#8217;s the schedule, which is, you know what everybody is always interested in seeing, like, who&#8217;s going to be here? Coffee in the lobby. Happy about that, for sure. You know, opening remarks as we call the event greeting here. And then you&#8217;ve got some, Tim, you and I are speaking at the same time. How did that happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:11:25&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s the way the schedule works out when you have tracks like this, you have to balance and make sure that you don&#8217;t have any overlapping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:11:33&nbsp; Topics. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:11:35&nbsp; Yeah. So there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s definitely like in the flex track, which is green when it&#8217;s heavily marketing or design related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:11:40&nbsp; The other talks are more content and dev. Yeah. So, it was a hard balance when you have this many speakers. It&#8217;s like doing a wedding reception table seating.&nbsp; Figure out who has to be next to each other and who can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:11:55&nbsp; So you know, it is nice to go first thing though, because then you&#8217;ve ripped off the band aid and like the rest of the day, is your own, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:12:01&nbsp; So yeah. And set the tone for the day too, right. So a lot of strong people leading off each track and then go from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:09&nbsp; And you&#8217;ve got Jen Witkowski, you&#8217;ve got Lucas Manuel Alvarado, Kaitlin Bolling, Jim Brandt, Femi Lewis. Oh, I love Femi. She&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:12:17&nbsp; Christian Taylor&#8217;s coming too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:20&nbsp; Yeah. Christian from Craylor Media. Yep, I know Christian. He and I, met for the first time in person over at WordCamp Asia. Phenomenal. Doing so much work, in WordPress as far as news and sharing that kind of stuff. David Jackson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:12:33&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;ll point out my buddy Jordan from Orlando, who no one&#8217;s ever probably heard of in this community, but, for the sports fans or even general marketing fans, he&#8217;s behind the viral campaigns for the Pop Tarts College Bowl Game that have happened the last couple of years with the crazy Pop Tart stuff that&#8217;s happened, and he&#8217;s doing a talk on, kind of how that idea went from a bar. The typical bar napkin story to actually, like, winning the business and being like, oh, we have to actually do something now and then. It turned out to be amazing. And it went viral, like for a week, two years in a row, two different campaings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:09&nbsp; That&#8217;s very cool. I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:13:12&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:13:12&nbsp; It’s just super meta just because Color Code happened on a bar napkin, it kind of. Yeah, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:17&nbsp; I&#8217;m not surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:13:18&nbsp; At Gene McCarthy&#8217;s over wings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:21&nbsp; We got Coriano Harris. Hue Got This, I like that. And then, Aaron Reimann, who is down in Atlanta area, Robert DeVore, Levi Neuland, Tamara Zantell, and then the, I guess keynote?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:13:39&nbsp; Yeah kinda of. We wanted to bring everyone together at the end of the day in one room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:43&nbsp; And Natalie Munger, with Utilizing Heuristics to Improve Design, I love that. And then you do have an after party, I think, too, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:13:49&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. Ron, you want to talk about that? It&#8217;s in the works, but there&#8217;s it&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:13:53&nbsp; Yeah, we just kind of locked it down. Earlier today. So it&#8217;s going to be at, Pearl Street Brewery, which is a short walk away. You know, so, like, that&#8217;s kind of the cool thing about having it in downtown Buffalo, you know, the hotels that you&#8217;re going to stay at. You know, in our past, our WordCamps, you know, we had them in smaller communities and there weren&#8217;t really hotels. So you&#8217;re always just driving to the event or getting an Airbnb somewhere. Here like we&#8217;re in the heart of the city. Like our speaker networking event, you&#8217;re going to hop on on the train and take it right up Main Street, you know? So everything&#8217;s like, right right there, very accessible from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:35&nbsp; Yeah, yeah. Here, I&#8217;ll give you a chance to thank your, your sponsors now too. So you&#8217;ve got WP Engine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:14:42&nbsp; Yup WP Engine came in big and then you&#8217;ll see a bunch of the, the agencies and local colleges and stuff. And GoDaddy came in pretty big too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:49&nbsp; What&#8217;s FTN?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:14:51&nbsp; Oh that&#8217;s Agency Fifteen. That&#8217;s a local agency. Creative agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:54&nbsp; Nice. Luminous. Cani, and Douglas Development are collaborative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:15:00&nbsp; So props to Douglas. That tower. We are using the venue at no cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette:&nbsp; That&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard: I mean, when you see, when you see the venue and you see what they&#8217;re offering us to be able to do at no cost. Another reason why the tickets are low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:15:15&nbsp; I was going to say that&#8217;s definitely contributes to that low ticket price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:15:18&nbsp; It&#8217;s insane. It&#8217;s such a good location and it will really facilitate like an amazing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:15:24&nbsp; You got Mr. Smith, Parkway, Martin, Canisius University, Kinsta, and then Black Space Creative, Ninteen, Breakdance and Lighthouse Marketing. And if people are interested, they can absolutely subscribe to the newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:15:36&nbsp; Now you have I&#8217;m going to stop sharing because I think I&#8217;ve shown almost everything. You have listed it says Buffalo. But it looks like there&#8217;s room for more events, since the Buffalo is kind of like the subset of the site. Do you have plans at this point? Is it kind of leaving it open for future ideas?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:15:57&nbsp; It&#8217;s it&#8217;s leaving it open right now. There is a plan, but there are no plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:16:05&nbsp; We the concept of a concept of a plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:16:08&nbsp; We have concepts of a plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:16:09&nbsp; Definitely concepts of a plan. We have had interest expressed by various sponsors that they would sponsor further events, too. So this is one of those things where if we have a formula to build an event like this that operates in the same way that people are used to with WordCamps, and we can spice up the national circuit a little bit with a handful of events each year. We can build out our organizer network. And, you know, it doesn&#8217;t have to be a big project for us. We don&#8217;t have to take over the world at this point. It&#8217;s about variety. Even locally Michelle, you&#8217;re, you know, in Rochester, you&#8217;re very active in WordPress and have done WordCamp Rochester too. Do we really need two WordCamps 70 miles apart from each other?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:16:56&nbsp; Right. And we&#8217;ve talked about having we&#8217;ve talked about having WordCamp Western New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:17:00&nbsp; Or doing work on Western New York and combining efforts. Right. So, you know, like Ron said, it&#8217;s a very good opportunity to expand our horizons and take what we learned for ten years off of the WordCamp and then make something else that we can inject into potentially some different cities, too, but definitely in Western New York. And it&#8217;s something that complements WordCamp very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:17:20&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. So tickets are still on sale, which is great. So if people are interested, finding tickets, do you have. I didn&#8217;t look because I live local enough. Do you have information about hotel stays and things like that? Venue information on the site recommended hotels, anything like that? or should they just go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:17:38&nbsp; To those specifically there? But to Ron&#8217;s point. The venue is downtown and if you do a Google map search, you&#8217;re going to find hotels within one train stop or walking distance. And it&#8217;s buffalo. So, they aren&#8217;t super expensive. Although there is a Shane Gillis comedy act at the arena that night, so you never know who&#8217;s coming into town buying up these hotel rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:17:58&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never heard of that person, so maybe it&#8217;s not as big as I don&#8217;t know. So whenever we have an event here in Rochester, the question is, the question from outside is, will you have garbage plates? The question from inside is we&#8217;re not going to have garbage plates, are we? So the question in Buffalo is, will there be wings at the after party or what can people expect?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:18:22&nbsp; Yeah I, I believe so. We&#8217;re going to have food, you know, like food is always a part of these things. We haven&#8217;t finalized the menu yet, but you know, I generally like to provide some Buffalo staples, especially when I know we have people coming in from out of town.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:40&nbsp; I&#8217;m the same way as long as it&#8217;s mild, I. I love buffalo flavor. Not so much the. Not so much the spice. So to get back to something you said very early on, which was about pineapple on pizza. The pineapple on pizza question across the world is very similar to the Buffalo Western New York question of would you ever dip a wing in ranch?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard00:19:05&nbsp; No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Ron Brennan: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:06&nbsp; You lose your buffalo card if you do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:19:09&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s always blue cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:10&nbsp; Yeah. Blue cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:19:11&nbsp; And if it&#8217;s done right, it&#8217;s either homemade blue cheese by the restaurant or if you have to, it&#8217;s Rudy&#8217;s blue cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan: Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:17&nbsp; There you go. I&#8217;m sure Rochester doesn&#8217;t have either of those. So we take what we can get, but I think most of the time it&#8217;s Marie&#8217;s blue cheese? But, it will do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:19:26&nbsp; That&#8217;s another one. People use that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:29&nbsp; In a pinch. Right? So what else? What else do you want to talk about with the event? What can people look forward to? What are you most excited about? And, is the stress levels hitting yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:19:40&nbsp; it&#8217;s not super stressful. I mean, like, Fortunately, because we got started early, at this point, it&#8217;s just about making sure people know tickets are there, making sure they know the event exists. You know, we&#8217;ve been doing as much daily, almost, posting about speakers and sponsors and things on, on, you know, like X, Facebook, LinkedIn, all that good stuff. But one thing we haven&#8217;t talked about yet is the, Live graffiti art competition that will happen throughout the day in the lobby. Ben, who&#8217;s not here to talk about it. So we&#8217;ll do our best to do it for him. Is running essentially a large, sticky, note easel competition where we&#8217;ll have markers and things set up out in the lobby in a certain area and people throughout the day, if they want to either skip a session or between sessions. I don&#8217;t know what the official plan is for what will be done in terms of the art that&#8217;s done, but, do something and put it up on. Yes. Art battle. Art battle. 100%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:20:39&nbsp; This is answering June’s question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:20:41&nbsp; And it kind of. it kind of, vibes with, sticker that we have that we&#8217;re giving all the attendees and also the t-shirt option that we have, which is the Responsive by Design &#8211;&nbsp; Naughty by Nature reference. Yeah, I love that. there&#8217;s a little bit of this weird subtheme that we just decided to inject in that&#8217;s kind of like urban hip hop 80s. I don&#8217;t know, it just it seemed fun, so we just went for it. But there will be art battle stuff. There actually will be some interactive voting towards the second half of the day, and there will be three winners of gift gift cards at the end of the day, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:17&nbsp; So can I make a suggestion for next year&#8217;s t-shirt?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaker 4 00:21:20&nbsp; Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:21&nbsp; It&#8217;s black. It&#8217;s just black lettering on a white shirt, but it&#8217;s open lettering and it comes with Sharpie markers. So while you&#8217;re going through the day, you can color in your own Color Code shirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:21:32&nbsp; I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:21:33&nbsp; Interactive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:35&nbsp; Swag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:21:36&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:21:36&nbsp; Interactive swag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:37&nbsp; Somebody write that down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard<strong> </strong>00:21:39&nbsp; We are. We&#8217;re getting a lot of good support from the sponsors too. So there will actually be things like swag bags when you check in. I mean, it&#8217;s just like we&#8217;ve gotten so much support from the people, that not only have done financial support, but they&#8217;re trying to make it so that the attendees have like a very top notch one day conference experience. So that&#8217;s I&#8217;m looking forward to that, to you and being able to provide that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:22:03&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s going to be cool to have, like we&#8217;re going to have and then really never happens here. I mean, occasionally we&#8217;ll see other other marketing agency people at networking events or whatever. And, you know, some of us talk or whatever on, on online. But to have this group of people that are there in the same room together. Like I&#8217;m excited about that. You know, just what kind of collaborations and what kind of ideas can spark from just those side conversations that, you know, we&#8217;re never really in all in the same room like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:22:38&nbsp; Yeah. So does that mean the hallway track is going to be exciting too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:22:42&nbsp; Hallway tracks are always exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:22:43&nbsp; Haha! Opportunities to meet new people for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:22:48&nbsp; There&#8217;s there&#8217;s a lot of decent topics. I mean, we were scrolling through the the speaker list in the schedule. I mean, there will be AI topics and, you know, there&#8217;s the typical like content topics and there&#8217;s a few hot button topics. You know, the the new a new CMS someone is building is pretty cool. I&#8217;m going to be talking about decoupling yourself from Google because I personally am starting to hate Google. But like, you know, you have to live with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan:&nbsp; How can it be done?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard: How do you play the game? I don&#8217;t know, right? Or I do know and I&#8217;m going to talk about it. But there&#8217;s a lot of decent like hot button topics that are coming up too. So I think even from a professional level, it&#8217;s not these aren&#8217;t like throwaway speaker presentations, even though they&#8217;re volunteer speakers. There&#8217;s going to be a lot of meat to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:23:31&nbsp; Yeah, I realize that it&#8217;ll be hard for people to see necessarily, but the schedule is very concise. It&#8217;s also very colorful. I like that. but yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of amazing topics. I&#8217;m. I&#8217;m also glad that my talk is done early, because otherwise I have a tendency to, like, obsess about it and sit in the green room and work on it too much. And this way it&#8217;ll be done and I can go listen to other topics as well, which is a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:23:52&nbsp; Yeah, and there&#8217;s so many cool stories there, like Tamara, from The Foundry. she&#8217;s like second last talk in the in the second track there. The Future of Entrepreneurship. Like, she literally like her whole thing. And her whole career now has been to support her daughter, who was a young entrepreneur and had this product that she created and blew up into a company. And so she had to, you know, build out the support system to help her daughter turn this idea into a company. And now she&#8217;s teaching and, you know, kind of mentors young entrepreneurs. So this should be a really interesting, interesting talk there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:24:35&nbsp; Yeah, for sure. There&#8217;s a lot of really, really cool stuff on the schedule. If people want to learn more here, let me change things up here a little bit. I do have a banner. I have a banner for this. Just go to colorcode.events in your browser and you will be able to see the whole schedule. Read up about the speakers and the topics, see more of what&#8217;s being planned for the day and for what&#8217;s up to the minute stuff. Go ahead on go on X. I still call it Twitter. Guys, I&#8217;m sorry, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:25:04&nbsp; It’s Twitter. It’s both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:05&nbsp; Yeah @colorCodeEvents. it&#8217;s nice that you have the, you name something that had the URL available. That&#8217;s not always easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:25:17&nbsp; Not for Instagram though. Instagram. It was taken by some unused account. So it&#8217;s like I think it&#8217;s hellocolorcode on Instagram.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:24&nbsp; But yeah, there&#8217;s ways around things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:25:26&nbsp; But there&#8217;s always something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:28&nbsp; Exactly. But yeah. And you can get your tickets right on the website as well. Colorcode.events right now they are. What did we say, $40 for a ticket? To attend for the full day. And that includes lunch?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:25:39&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:41&nbsp; And the after party as well. So make sure that you sign up for that, especially if you&#8217;re in the area. But honestly, why wouldn&#8217;t you want to come anyway? And plus make a whole weekend of it? It&#8217;s just a hop, skip and a jump away from Niagara Falls. So you could actually, on Sunday, go and check out the falls or even Saturday night or Friday night or whatever. And, I love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:25:59&nbsp; That we have our friends from, you know, Niagara Falls, Canada coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:03&nbsp; Yep. Exactly. It&#8217;ll be good. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. Yeah. Anything else you&#8217;d like to mention about it other than sign up? Come, join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:26:13&nbsp; I think we&#8217;re going to be. We&#8217;re going to try. we&#8217;re not streaming it, but we are going to try and record every track and then, you know, get it up on a on a YouTube or make it available through the website in some way, shape or form or some combination of Tim&#8217;s cameras and our mics and whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:31&nbsp; Yeah, excellent. That&#8217;ll be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:26:33&nbsp; Because we love torture. So we&#8217;re going to do that to ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:26:36&nbsp; That&#8217;s right. You know how that goes with with WordCamps. You know, then the footage will be there as well. Anybody edit it and actually upload it or will it sit on a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:26:47&nbsp; It&#8217;s important though. It&#8217;s you know, we&#8217;ve run an event like this for ten years, but this is the first event. And we want to make sure that people can see what it was, what it was about, what types of quality topics we had and speakers. So, you know, we think that there&#8217;s something here. And if we can make sure that we&#8217;re always pushing out the quality of this, then, you know, it makes it more possible for us to potentially do another city at some point. And it&#8217;s not just in Buffalo in the northeast. It could be in the southeast, it could be Midwest, it could be whatever. You know, there&#8217;s creatives, marketers and devs all over the country. Could be in Canada, could be in Europe, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:27:28&nbsp; Europe, yeah, it could be Europe. Color Code Europe/</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:27:30&nbsp; It&#8217;s only a concept of a plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:27:33&nbsp; Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:27:34&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:27:35&nbsp; The concept of a plan. We have a couple people watching. If you have questions. Now is your time to put them in the comments before we wrap up for the day. I guess I have. I&#8217;m out of questions, I don&#8217;t know, are you still looking for sponsors or are you still in need of sponsors? And not so much?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:27:51 Well, always. We&#8217;re the high, ticket sponsors are all taken up there. We&#8217;re always open to someone doing a low level if they want to grab a ticket and a low level sponsorship just to support it. We&#8217;ll always welcome that. So there&#8217;s still time to do that, but will it? It&#8217;s not critical for the event. It&#8217;s all set up, ready to go. We&#8217;re just get people on the tickets, get people the event. We&#8217;re going to have a great time, listen to some quality talks, meet some cool people, then do it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:28:20&nbsp; Sounds good. I&#8217;m looking forward to it. I will be there bright and early. So are you coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:28:25&nbsp; Your coming&nbsp; the night before right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:28:28&nbsp; I was planning to. I don&#8217;t have anybody in the area to help me with my scooter at the hotel. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s stopping me from coming out the night early the night before, so I was going to drive in super early on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:28:38&nbsp; Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:28:40&nbsp; But we can always talk later. If you know somebody that is in, is around and can help. But otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:28:45 That’s crazy we are here. I say that we&#8217;re we&#8217;re here like, you know, we were talking a little bit earlier on about your first WordCamp in Buffalo. Yeah. And, so that was the back in the good old days when Ben used to sneak, like, 150 people into the Canisius cafeteria, and that&#8217;s where we had the WordCamp. So that was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:29:08&nbsp; We&#8217;ve come a long way, baby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:29:09&nbsp; That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s where your first one was. Right at Canisius?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette&nbsp; 00:29:13&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:29:14&nbsp; I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s where I met you at Canisius. Yeah. And. Yeah. And then I found out after I didn&#8217;t know this, but I was like, I thought we had permission. And Ben&#8217;s like, no, nobody. I&#8217;m like, you just had 150 people show up here. And nobody questioned?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:29:27&nbsp; Nobody blinked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:29:29&nbsp; Yeah, everybody knew about it but Canisius. But it was cool. It was a good event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:29:33&nbsp; It was like a it was a good event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:29:35&nbsp; I met my first developer, Tommy, who is now our current developer, again at that event at Canisius. He was just graduating from school, actually, through one of Ben&#8217;s programs. And that&#8217;s the type of thing you can do. It&#8217;s a good recruiting place, good networking place. It&#8217;s a good learning place. And genuinely, like, we know when this community gets together, whether it&#8217;s WordPress or marketing or creative or just that side of it, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s always good people. So yeah, we look forward to bringing those people together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:30:01&nbsp; Will you have a job board people can write openings on, and people who are looking for jobs like we do some events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:30:06&nbsp; You know, I thought about that and we haven&#8217;t set anything up. we do have a Slack channel, or property, whatever it&#8217;s called workspace that we have set up that we&#8217;re going to invite all the attendees into, probably after that 4/19 deadline so we can ramp up for two weeks and people can start chats in there and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:30:26&nbsp; Sounds good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:30:26&nbsp; Because we want to just bring people together as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:30:30&nbsp; Yeah, I think that&#8217;s awesome. I want to thank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:30:33&nbsp; Designers, developers, just any anybody that&#8217;s interested in, you know, learning more about some of the cool things that are being done or can be done, like this event, you know, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a great opportunity to network whether you&#8217;re looking to expand your career. You know, if I was in school as a computer science or developer or a, you know, a graphic designer or something right now, like this is an event, I would probably you&#8217;re going to have a bunch of the top marketing agencies in Buffalo on hand at this event, and it&#8217;s a great opportunity to expand that network and and just get out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:31:16&nbsp; Absolutely, and if you even are thinking about it like I&#8217;ve been asking women like, you know, advice for people who are thinking, women who are thinking about joining WordPress and joining tech. So, I mean, if you have an inkling or want to learn a little bit more about it and the kinds of people involved, it&#8217;s a really inexpensive ticket to spend the day networking with folks and learning as much as you can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:31:37&nbsp; Yeah, and hopefully the weather cooperates with us. It&#8217;ll be May. May can be very nice in Buffalo. It could also be not nice. Who knows?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:31:45&nbsp; I mean, we had snow yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:31:47&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping we can show off the city because it, you know, when the weather breaks in the city, it&#8217;s one of the best ones to to visit in the summertime. But there&#8217;s good people here, and we&#8217;re in a good spot downtown, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:32:01&nbsp; Absolutely. Well, guys, don&#8217;t go anywhere. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and end this. But I want to talk to you for just a couple of minutes before we go. Thank you so much for being here. Really appreciate learning more and and being able to share this event with people through Post Status. if you are listening, go to colorcode.events for more information. And I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to be here next week, but I will have another Post Status Happiness Hour live next week and we&#8217;ll be here to chat with everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim Bouchard 00:32:28&nbsp; Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Michelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron Brennan 00:32:30&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n<p>This article, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-happiness-hour-session-twenty-five/\">Post Status Happiness Hour Session Twenty Five</a>, was published at  <a href=\"https://poststatus.com\">Post Status</a> — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Apr 2025 21:30:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: Layoffs: Survivor’s Guilt and Fear of Being Next\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=163488\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/survivors-guilt-and-fear-of-being-next/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7843:\"<p>Since being laid off in February, I&#8217;ve had a lot of conversations with others on both sides of layoffs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really hard to be in the tech job market (or any job market in this economy) right now, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/04/tech-layoffs-2025-list/\">so many recent layoffs</a>. As someone in the mix of it right now (and I haven&#8217;t been looking that earnestly yet, as I&#8217;ve been taking some time to regroup, heal from feelings through the process, and decide what my next steps are) I understand the mental burden, the anxiety, and the fear that comes with being on the job market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am privileged to be in a place financially that has afforded me some time off as I strategize. Others are not as fortunate and need to find work immediately to keep paying bills and putting food on the table for their families. It&#8217;s not easy, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s also not easy for those at the companies doing layoffs who are still employed there. There are so many feelings that come with being a &#8220;layoff survivor.&#8221; Yet to talk about those feelings seems so insensitive to those who are job searching like crazy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, it&#8217;s hard on both sides of the issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While on the one hand, clearly, it&#8217;s difficult to be in a place where you&#8217;re suddenly looking for new employment, desperately trying to make sure you spend wisely to get you through to your next job, the truth is that <em>it&#8217;s mentally difficult to be a survivor, too.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting where I am at the moment, polishing my résumé, reading through job posts, it <em>could</em> (or should) be difficult to have sympathy for those <em>working</em>, but I&#8217;ve been in both places. I&#8217;ve been the person still in the company watching friends and colleagues suddenly wondering what to do next, and I&#8217;ve been where I am now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-survivor-s-guilt-is-real-so-is-dread\">Survivor&#8217;s Guilt is Real. So is Dread.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It really doesn&#8217;t feel good when your employer has to do layoffs &#8211; even when you are one of the people still employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You may feel guilty when you see others being laid off and you&#8217;re still holding your job. This is a normal response in this situation. It&#8217;s difficult to see coworkers and friends lose their roles. Feeling bad for them is normal. It&#8217;s also normal to feel a sort of survivor&#8217;s guilt that you still have your role.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You may also feel the dread of &#8220;waiting for the other shoe to drop.&#8221; Feeling like it could be you next causes anxiety. This is also a normal feeling. Anything that disrupts the status quo of your working environment &#8211; real or virtual &#8211; can make you feel off-kilter at best, and dread at worst.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Layoffs usually happen when there is a surplus of workers for the demand, mostly based on sales. So feeling the dread of wondering if you will be included in the next wave of layoffs (or wondering if there <em>will be </em>a next wave) is very normal. And while there aren&#8217;t any words anyone can give you to make you feel 100% secure, you should know that a wave of layoffs isn&#8217;t a whim, and is planned well in advance to combat issues that have been rising over time, so if your job is still in place following layoffs, you should be fairly confident that you will continue to be employed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also common after layoffs to have workloads redistributed, so you may feel some dread or anxiety if your workload is increased. Be sure to communicate with your supervisor what is actually doable, and what is too much to expect one person to accomplish. A company&#8217;s decision to do layoffs shouldn&#8217;t mean that those still working are taxed with more work than they can handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-talk-to-someone-who-has-been-laid-off\">How to Talk to Someone Who Has Been Laid Off</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, please <em>do</em> talk to those you want to remain friends (or friendly) with after they have been removed from their roles. Being laid off can feel like you&#8217;ve just been evicted from a home. You&#8217;ve often lost access to either a physical space you&#8217;re used to, or a digital one, or both. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not being in Slack channels with people you worked with, losing access to email and calendars, and watching access to work spaces disappear feels like you&#8217;ve been excommunicated from a community, when it&#8217;s really just a business protecting its own assets and following protocols. Reaching out to folks after the fact can help bridge the gap they feel between themselves and people they were used to working with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Do</strong> ask friends how they are doing and if they need to chat. Reaching out to check in, to say you enjoyed working together, or just to say you miss someone is a lovely way to stay connected.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> ask them &#8220;have you found a job yet&#8221; or &#8220;how is the job search going.&#8221; This often feels like pressure, and having to say &#8220;no, I haven&#8217;t&#8221; feels bad. There is so much self doubt at this point in a person&#8217;s life, that added pressure by others about the job just feels oppressive and embarrassing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do</strong> offer to take them to coffee (or a coffee zoom) and be a listening ear.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> badmouth the company or allow them to make you feel uncomfortable if they do.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do</strong> offer to help if you can: review a résumé, make a call, serve as a reference, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t</strong> take anything they&#8217;ve shared with you back to the office to repeat to others. Don&#8217;t betray their trust.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do</strong> offer reassurance, without sounding trite. Saying things like &#8220;I know you&#8217;ll land something soon,&#8221; or &#8220;you&#8217;ll be fine&#8221; aren&#8217;t helpful.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nice, but not necessary</strong>, you can always gift someone a gift card for coffee, a meal, or something they enjoy as a hobby. (When I received a few of these, they made me feel valued, seen, and supported.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-protect-your-mental-health\">Protect Your Mental Health</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of who was laid off in your company, none of their current situation is based on anything that <em>you</em> did or didn&#8217;t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaning into guilt, anxiety, and dread doesn&#8217;t help someone else, and only hurts yourself, your mental wellbeing, and, potentially, your work performance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are struggling with your mental response to layoffs at your company, please find a trusted person, therapist, or doctor to talk to. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-if-you-have-been-laid-off\">If You Have Been Laid Off&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are resources to help you.

class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2025/02/hidden-backdoors-uncovered-in-wordpress-malware-investigation.html\">Sucuri researchers</a> have noticed a new trend of malicious code hidden in the WordPress mu-plugins directory.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/plugins/mu-plugins/\">Must-Use (MU) plugin</a> is a special type of WordPress plugin that automatically executes on every page load without requiring activation like other plugins in the dashboard.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In order to create an MU plugin, an attacker must gain access to the site by exploiting compromised themes, plugins, or credentials.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sucuri researchers have found 3 specific payloads being added to MU plugins:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Redirect.php</strong>: redirects visitors (other than bots and logged-in admins) to page that attempts to trick them into downloading malware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Index.php</strong>: a particularly dangerous webshell UI that allows execution of PHP code from a GitHub repository.<br /><strong>Custom-js-loader.php</strong>: replaces all images on the site with adult content and redirects all links to dangerous websites.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While many agencies already have a good process for protecting against compromised themes, plugins, and credentials, adding file change notices and/or regular audits of the mu-plugins directory is something to consider.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"gb-headline

exact match for a search keyword, it was almost a guarantee you&#8217;d be at the top of the search results.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While exact match domains no longer guarantee SEO success like they used to, they can still provide value as part of a marketing strategy that prioritizes memorability and trust.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Local businesses in particular can benefit from geo-specific exact match domains, especially in competitive service industries <em>(think chicagoplumber.com or dallaselectrician.com).</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Plus, voice search and AI assistants have made memorable, easily pronounced domain names more valuable than ever.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>&#8220;If your domain sounds like a real brand, people will treat it like one – and so will search engines.&#8221;</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Learn more about <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/exact-match-domains-value-453837\">exact match domains</a> and the <a

Who serves as the Partnerships and Community Manager for North America. They discuss various topics including the WordPress community, Kinsta&#8217;s new affiliate program, and their global sponsorship of WordCamps. The episode also highlights the creation of collaborative music playlists within the Post Status Slack community and the importance of concise, engaging content. Additionally, the guest shares insights on supporting WordPress contributors and the launch of Kinsta&#8217;s new automatic updates feature for themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-top-takeaways\">Top Takeaways: </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The Importance of Thorough Testing in Software Development and Releases:</strong> Michelle emphasized the critical role of testing and feedback during the release cycle of WordPress 6.8, particularly as they approach its official launch. Despite having a dedicated testing community, the need for more testers is constant to ensure compatibility with a wide range of plugins and themes. The takeaway is that comprehensive testing is vital for minimizing issues at launch, and encouraging more community involvement can help ensure smoother releases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Value of Consistent Community Contribution and Support for Open Source Projects:</strong> Roger highlighted the importance of documentation in open-source projects like WordPress, noting that it&#8217;s often underappreciated until something goes wrong. He also spoke about Kinsta’s involvement in supporting the community through contributions, such as sponsoring WordCamp and supporting documentation initiatives. The takeaway is that consistent, behind-the-scenes contributions, like documentation and community support, are crucial for the sustainability and success of open-source projects, even though they are often taken for granted.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Kinsta’s Automatic Updates Feature Enhances Site Reliability:</strong> Roger introduced Kinsta’s new Automatic Updates feature, which ensures WordPress sites remain updated while minimizing risks. The system takes a before-and-after screenshot during updates and automatically reverts changes if visual differences are detected, helping prevent website issues that could impact business operations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\">Mentioned In The Show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/\">Kinsta</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://linuxcontainers.org/\">Linux container project  </a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp US</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://sevalla.com/\">Sevalla</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/dg/brand/cloudflare-enterprise/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=ao-fy-acq-namer_en-connectivity-en-txt-general-brand_product&utm_content=brand_umbrella_core&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CLOUD_ACQ_AOFY_CNC_GOOGLE_GENERAL_TXT_NAMER-EN_NA_MOFU_GENERAL_X_LEAD-GEN_BRAND-PRODUCT&utm_content=Brand_Umbrella_Core&campaignid=71700000121545787&adgroupid=58700008860151626&creativeid=739454660289&&utm_term=cloudflare%20enterprise_go_cmp-20146409196_adg-152212902947_ad-739454660289_kwd-418069705345_dev-c_ext-_prd-_sig-CjwKCAjwwLO_BhB2EiwAx2e-3300Ih7Dbq0XKzasJpuOGihSN2zBmtYH097QVZ3Am_X10ChkNQSbvhoCZNUQAvD_BwE&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwwLO_BhB2EiwAx2e-3300Ih7Dbq0XKzasJpuOGihSN2zBmtYH097QVZ3Am_X10ChkNQSbvhoCZNUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\">Cloudflare Enterprise</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions\">StackOverflow</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http://meetup.com\">Meetup.com</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/\">WordPress Foundation</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://esoterracider.com/\">EsoTerra Cidery</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/changelog/kinsta-automatic-updates/\">Kinsta Automatic Updates</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sponsor-wordpress-com\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpresscom\">WordPress.com</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Build and manage professional sites with secure managed hosting on WordPress.com.

So I switched back to my old school wired in headphones, and all I&#8217;ve got are these really old sennheiser&#8217;s that I had to tape with, rainbow duct tape years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:39&nbsp; It looks like you have a pretty little bow in your hair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:00:43&nbsp; Perfect, perfect. That&#8217;s what that&#8217;s that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:47&nbsp; I mean, but you know what, Roger? On you it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:00:51&nbsp; Well, thank you, I appreciate that. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:54&nbsp; And thanks for joining me today on the Happiness Hour. I it&#8217;s it&#8217;s always a pleasure to talk to you for multiple reasons, chief, of course, is that you&#8217;re a wonderful person to talk to. But also, I get to see those pictures of your dog in the background and like, who wouldn&#8217;t love those pictures? The dogs, I think one, two dogs, right? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:01:13&nbsp; Two dogs. Yeah. So, Daisy. Well, Daisy over here and then Enzo&#8217;s over here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:01:17&nbsp; Yeah, yeah. Just adorable. Adorable. I would love to claim all of the wildlife as my own and my pictures, but alas, they do not live with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:01:27&nbsp; Well, that&#8217;s that&#8217;s a lot cheaper. You don&#8217;t have to maintain as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:01:29&nbsp; True, true. I do have a cat that lives behind my monitor because she has a little bed back there. She likes it back there because I can&#8217;t reach her and she can stay out of it. Like I can&#8217;t make her accept my hugs and kisses, basically. But she comes up and stretches every once in a while and, you know, let&#8217;s me pet her for a second. But anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:01:48&nbsp; So she represents cats very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:01:50&nbsp; Yeah she does. She&#8217;s got it down pat. She realizes I&#8217;m the staff. I&#8217;m not the owner. So it&#8217;s all good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: Nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: So first let me say welcome not only to the show, but Kinsta we got everything in the works right now. Any moment we should be able to. I&#8217;m going to officially announce the soft launch of the sponsorship of Post Status. So welcome. As a sponsor, we created our own little sponsorship channel with you all today, and I&#8217;m open for those conversations. It&#8217;s really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:02:21&nbsp; I mean once there&#8217;s a sponsor channel in Slack that makes it official, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:02:25&nbsp; It does, it does. It&#8217;s just the the just. And we signed the contract. It&#8217;s just that little payment thing. And I know that you guys are good for it. So we&#8217;re gonna announce it anyway. So so welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:02:36&nbsp; Absolutely. Thank you.&nbsp; Yeah. Excited to be part of the community and and help. you know, I know it&#8217;s $50 a year now. Like, what, a smoking deal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: Yeah, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:02:47&nbsp; I am encouraging everybody to join. I actually just had a great conversation with Joost, and we talked about, you know, his kind of goal and mission with, you know, making Post Status into a nonprofit and really making it that community that can have all of the conversations, you know, and have the spicy conversations, right. And, and still manage to be a group of people that get along. And so that&#8217;s really encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:17&nbsp; And we do fun stuff, too. I don&#8217;t know if you saw it, but we started a new channel today called The Music Channel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: And I got an official like, I paid for an official Spotify account today called Post Status, and I have two playlists in there that are open to collaboration amongst our community. So if you&#8217;re in Post Status Slack and you go to the music channel, you will see you can add to those playlists. One is for folks who like mellow music when they work, and the other is for people who like upbeat music when they work. So you can just add to that playlist or building playlists two playlists together as a community for for fun, right? Because you can do that. We can do those fun things there. And I really enjoy that too. So it&#8217;s pretty cool stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:04:04&nbsp; That&#8217;s really awesome. I love the initiative there. It&#8217;s always interesting to hear what other people listen to. When their getting work done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:04:13&nbsp; Yeah. Can I tell you my biggest fear was that because I had to seed it with something, right. So I put like two songs in each one and I thought, I&#8217;m going to be judged so hard by these four songs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:04:24&nbsp; Okay. What were the songs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaker 3 00:04:26&nbsp; Oh, now I gotta go back and look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:04:27&nbsp; Okay, hold on a second. I put in You Don&#8217;t Know Me, which is a Ray Charles&nbsp; &amp; Diana Krall song. This is the mellow one. Yeah. which I think nobody but I&#8217;m a huge Josh Groban fan. So the other one was When You Say You Love Me by Josh Groban.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:04:42&nbsp; And then the upbeat songs. I actually did a little research. See, I listened to 70s music all the time, like 70s and 80s. That&#8217;s what I was doing. So I did a little research. I&#8217;m like, what are upbeat songs that people like to listen to? And even though Coldplay gets a bad rap sometimes. Viva la Vida was the number one song on multiple lists. So that and On Top of the World by Imagine Dragons. Were the four that I seeded. Two each, you know two each into those things. And I thought nobody so far has said, Michelle, your taste in music is awful. So we&#8217;re gonna let it ride. We&#8217;re gonna let it ride. If I need to, I can always delete them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:05:16&nbsp; I feel like you went with some pretty safe choices there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:19&nbsp; I mean, I tried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:05:20&nbsp; Good songs, good bands, so. And. And now it&#8217;s up to people to, proliferate the lists with their ideas. And I&#8217;m looking forward to see what people start sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:33&nbsp; Yeah. Well, on the upbeat songs, I will say Corey Maass went to work on it because we got we&#8217;re up to 18 songs on that playlist and we have five on the other playlist. So yeah. So if you are not a member of Post Status and you want to be, it&#8217;s only $50 a year, you can influence these playlists. Us. I mean, I&#8217;m going to start listening to him tomorrow and see, you know, how much work I get done. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:05:54&nbsp; I&#8217;ll tell you what. I feel like we&#8217;re in a telethon type situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:57&nbsp; I know right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:06:00&nbsp; You&#8217;re standing by to take your call. Let&#8217;s let&#8217;s see what you let&#8217;s get joining up here, people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:05&nbsp; Oh, my goodness. I&#8217;m old enough to have grown up on the Jerry Lewis telethons where he&#8217;s like, let&#8217;s see that tote board. Right. As the numbers flip over and like, the old alarm clocks did. It was so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:06:16&nbsp; Funny. Absolutely. No, I used to remember they would always come on, like, PBS and stuff when I was one to watch the new Star Trek series or something. And I&#8217;m like, you guys are killing me. I&#8217;ve got no money. I&#8217;m just a kid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:28&nbsp; Yeah, and all of the people they would bring on were like the old Love Boat type people. Like, it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t want to see Charo. I know she does good flamenco. Show me somebody I care about. Like. Yeah. But, you know, I mean, it was what it was. Donald O&#8217;Connor dancing at 78 years old. No, I don&#8217;t need to see that. But anyway. James says hello to both of us. Hey, James. Good to have you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:06:53&nbsp; I haven’t seen James in a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:55&nbsp; He&#8217;s a pretty awesome dude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:06:56&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:57&nbsp; He really is. So tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do at Kinsta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:07:03&nbsp; Oh, boy. Okay, so, so at Kinsta. I&#8217;ll just start there. I recently actually got, kind of a title change, so now I was Community Manager. Now I&#8217;m Partnerships and Community Manager for North America. And so what does that mean? So I get to go to a lot of events, and kind of try and engage the community, get feedback as far as, hey, you know, on the hosting product, get feedback about how what people are thinking about WordPress in general. And then I take that information back to the home base and share it with the powers that be and my coworkers to help improve the product and then also see how we can help. the WordPress project overall. And so one initiative that we&#8217;ve got going relatively recently is we&#8217;ve started sponsoring contributors to WordPress. And so that has been just a lot of fun, reaching out to different contributors and seeing, you know, how we can help them, help their work, and really improve WordPress. Because if WordPress doesn&#8217;t keep improving, there&#8217;s not a whole lot for Kinsta to do. So that&#8217;s kind of a new initiative. Other things. So with the partnership side, I talk with different companies that are adjacent to Kinsta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:08:30&nbsp; So agencies are a big one. We have a lot of agency customers. And we also have a lot of customers that use agencies. And so it&#8217;s very important that we have a dialogue with agencies as far as what works for them. What we could improve with the product and how we can help them grow their business as well.. And then also with like plugin makers and theme designers and, you know, the whole ecosystem of WordPress companies kind of works in there. And then also just going one step further is open source in general. So at Kinsta one thing that we&#8217;ve utilized for many years is Linux containers for each of the sites, isolates them, gives them a lot of resources. And so we help support the maintainer of the Linux container project, which is changing into Incus and getting a little in the weeds here. But so that&#8217;s really exciting too, is being able to reach out to the people who make the tools that allow us to make WordPress and allow us to host websites and help them get their work. Continued and supported. Jeez. And, you know, it&#8217;s a pretty nebulous position. So there&#8217;s there&#8217;s a lot of things going on. I do a lot of videos. I make videos on LinkedIn where I interview people in the WordPress ecosystem as well as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:09:57&nbsp; Those are compelling, by the way, because you keep them concise, right? They&#8217;re not they don&#8217;t go on for hours. They also are fun. You have topics that you put right there and and they just show up in your newsfeed. So you&#8217;re like, oh, what&#8217;s this all about? Those are awesome. I mean, even if I&#8217;m speaking from having been on the other side of your microphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:10:16&nbsp; Well, thank you so much. I appreciate the feedback and the encouragement. It it started as just a fun way to get to know presenters before WordCamp US last year. And then I went to WordCamp US and everybody, not everybody, but a lot of people wanted to ask me if they could be on my podcast. And I was like, well, first of all, it&#8217;s not really technically a podcast. But, Yeah. No, I wanted to interview more people, and I like, you know, LinkedIn imposes the 15 minute time rule that I have, which is kind of nice because it allows me. I&#8217;m only interrupting somebody&#8217;s day for 15 minutes, to do the interview. And then I&#8217;m only interrupting your day for 15 minutes if you want to watch the interview. So I feel like it&#8217;s very courteous of me in some ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:11:06&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:11:07&nbsp; But. And then there&#8217;s just a lot of fun. It&#8217;s an opportunity to get to know people in the industry, people that I maybe have known for a while and learn more about them and then meet new people and hear their stories and then help share their stories. So, that, like, that was like kind of an afterthought activity. And it&#8217;s really turned into a pretty considerable amount of my job. And, again, I get a lot of encouragement from my bosses to keep doing those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:11:36&nbsp; Yeah. It&#8217;s great, I love it. You&#8217;ve talked to some pretty awesome people. You&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people that I&#8217;ve never heard of or met before, too, which I love because you&#8217;re introducing people to the WordPress community that we want to know because they&#8217;re doing cool stuff. So I love that component of it as well, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:11:54&nbsp; That&#8217;s great to hear. And I&#8217;d like to say that that is all by design. A lot of it is just because I don&#8217;t know the big names in WordPress, and so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:04&nbsp; That&#8217;s okay too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:12:05&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t connected with them yet. But then also there is has been a little bit of a conscious decision to seek out people who are not getting as much exposure and maybe aren&#8217;t as well known, but who I&#8217;ve met one way or another. And I know that they&#8217;re very interesting people. And I mean, everybody&#8217;s got a story to tell. And I and I think the nice thing about 15 minutes is it makes it easy for people to tell their story and not run out of things to talk about. And so we, can we can put something together that&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:37&nbsp; Well, I will tell you that you did inspire something I&#8217;ve been working on, which is starting, last month. It is April now. Yep. Starting last month. Last month was Women&#8217;s History Month, and so I got it in my head on like the fourth or fifth day of the month. Oh, it&#8217;s women&#8217;s history. We should interview women in WordPress. I thought I would get maybe ten people, right? I have over 50 interviews now that I&#8217;ve recorded.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: Wow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: They average about five minutes. Some go as long as 12, some as short as like four. Which I guess is not really an average of five, but there&#8217;s about five minutes. Six maybe. And, they take out the outliers, but then, it&#8217;s been really awesome. And because there&#8217;s so many of them, I&#8217;m continuing it for months and it might just be a regular feature we have. We have a YouTube playlist. Now that&#8217;s these, women&#8217;s interviews within WordPress.&nbsp; And I am so proud to say that we have interviewed somebody on every inhabitable continent of the world. So I&#8217;ve got women from literally everywhere, which is so cool. But it&#8217;s because I saw your shorter, you know, concise interviews that I thought I could do, like Roger does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:13:44&nbsp; That&#8217;s awesome. I and I, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re blowing it out of the water. you&#8217;re way more composed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:49&nbsp; I&#8217;m having fun.I don&#8217;t know about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:13:53&nbsp; And I you know, I&#8217;m excited to hear that. And I think that, you know, in the age of these two and three and four hour podcasts, I really like seeing the shift back towards the shorter. You know, it&#8217;s the same way with like, streaming media, right? Like my wife and I, we really get excited when there&#8217;s an episode that&#8217;s only 25 minutes long. Right? Because, like, I just I got to go to bed at some point, people. You know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:18&nbsp; It&#8217;s it&#8217;s I call it consumable, right? It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed. You could actually consume it on social media as opposed to having to go someplace and download or look longer or pop popcorn first, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:14:31&nbsp; Exactly, Exactly. No. Yeah, yeah. Having these little bite sized nuggets. And, you know, there&#8217;s also the whole concept of, you know, do you need two hours to really say what you&#8217;re trying to say? Can you can you sum it up for me? And and I, you know, one of the approaches that I&#8217;m kind of doing with my show is once I have somebody on and I get to know, like, who they are and how we interact, then, you know, maybe I invite you back and we do a longer show if there&#8217;s something more for us to dig into. So, yeah, there&#8217;s just a lot of variability. I, I really I talked with Matt Medeiros, I think, last fall about my philosophy on doing the show, and there&#8217;s a lot of a salesman&#8217;s mentality to it. So in sales, to be successful at sales, you just have to deal with rejection and no&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:15:25&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:15:26&nbsp; And so one of the things I learned early in my sales career was to collect 50 no&#8217;s a day. And then I would get to a yes. Right? And and you know, the math sometimes worked and sometimes it didn&#8217;t, depending on what I was selling. Right? But I think with doing episodes, doing a show like this, especially when you&#8217;re starting out and you&#8217;re not sure what you want to talk about or how good your interviewing skills are, then go for numbers like just start. Do a lot of interviews, talk to a lot of people and figure it out as you&#8217;re going. And yeah, just getting the repetitions in and and seeing if you enjoy it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:16:05&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. But I do have to say it as a podcast, if you call it a show. So you&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve officially tipped over to that territory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger WIlliams: Okay. I thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: I don&#8217;t make the rules. I don&#8217;t make the rules. Roger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:16:19&nbsp; Okay. I thought that in order for it to be a podcast, it had to have an RSS feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:16:25&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think so. I think it has to be called a show and put out an in regular format somewhere. I make my own decisions here, so maybe I do make the rules, I don&#8217;t know. But,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:16:35&nbsp; You know, in your defense, you know, people are calling these shows on YouTube podcasts now, even though there’s no RSS feeds. So. All right, we&#8217;ll go with it. We&#8217;ll go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:16:43 &nbsp; Okay. Absolutely. So much fun. So if anybody doesn&#8217;t know what Kinsta is, what is Kinsta?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:16:51&nbsp; Oh wow. Okay. So if you don&#8217;t know what Kinsta is then what what&#8217;s going on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette:&nbsp; I know right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger WIlliams: Seriously, so Kinsta we&#8217;re a managed hosting company and we focus on WordPress. And then we&#8217;ve actually got a new product for application hosting and database hosting called Sevalla. And if people are interested, they can look that up. But I&#8217;ll really talk more about the WordPress side. That&#8217;s the majority of our business. We&#8217;ve been in business for over 12 years now. We&#8217;ve got hundreds of thousands of sites under management that were, helping people deliver to the world. And, you know, to back up for a second, what do I mean by managed hosting? So with managed hosting, we&#8217;re handling all of the infrastructure outside of WordPress. So the nginx server, the MySQL database, Linux. And then we&#8217;re also integrating with Cloudflare Enterprise. So every site on Kinsta has Cloudflare Enterprise protecting it from DDoS attacks. But also we&#8217;re utilizing their CDN and edge caching and image optimization services to really help speed up your site and make sure that anybody in the world that wants to view it can see it really quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:08&nbsp; Excellent, excellent. And you have an affiliate program, I noticed I&#8217;m actually going to put this banner up on the screen here. I&#8217;ve been digging into, it&#8217;s like I know what I&#8217;m doing sometimes, I don&#8217;t know, I surprise myself. I&#8217;ve been looking into doing more affiliate sales. Right? And I&#8217;ve signed up. I think I signed up for Kinsta. I did a whole bunch in one day. As you know, I was laid off from my last job, and I was like, where can I find some passive income? So I&#8217;m building a website, I&#8217;m doing reviews, I&#8217;m doing all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: And so, yeah. So here&#8217;s a way to do that. What does your affiliate program look like for people who might want to, you know, get involved with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:18:43&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, and I at at risk of making this sound like a whole sales pitch all, all day. I apologize to everybody. You&#8217;re asking the questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:53 I am of course, we didn&#8217;t talk about this and we didn&#8217;t talk about this beforehand either. These are just my curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:18:59&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m I&#8217;m enjoying it. So, our affiliate program is quite generous. You just go to the link that you see on the screen. kinsta.com/affiliates get signed up and we have our amazing affiliate team will review your application. And, once you&#8217;re signed up, you it&#8217;s pretty standard from an affiliate program. You get a link that has a specific code in it.

We pay you on signup so it&#8217;s anywhere from $50 to $500 depending on which plan somebody signs up for. And then you get 10% of whatever is billed for each month for the life of that account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:52&nbsp; There you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:19:53&nbsp; So our cheapest plan is $35 a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:57&nbsp; Least expensive marketing. Least expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:20:01&nbsp; Sorry. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:20:03&nbsp; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:20:04&nbsp; Our least expensive plan is $35 a month. So 10% of that&#8217;s $3.50 a month for the life of the account. And, you know, we don&#8217;t put any limits on when that&#8217;s going to end. We just keep paying you, as you know, you brought the business to us. So we&#8217;re going to pay you for that. So and thank you for it. You know, other than that, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s really straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:20:26&nbsp; We have, like I mentioned, a dedicated, an affiliate management team. So if you know, as you&#8217;re an affiliate, there&#8217;s ever any concerns or questions about a sign up, all you have to do is reach out and we&#8217;ll take a look at it and work with you. The, you know, one key time frame to put in there is about a two week limit. So if somebody signs up and they should have gotten credited to you, you need to reach out to us, you know, within two weeks, which isn&#8217;t an unreasonable amount of time to ask you to reach out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:20:58&nbsp; Not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:20:59&nbsp; And and we&#8217;ll work with you to figure all that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:02&nbsp; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:21:03&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ve built, the, the affiliate dashboard in-house. So it&#8217;s very snappy and.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:08&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:21:09 You know, and if you have feedback on, you know, in the improvements or suggestions, you know, our developers can take a look at those and choose to implement them. If, if it sounds like a good plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:20&nbsp; Nice. I have pulled up on the screen, as I&#8217;m sure you saw. Not only do you have the affiliate, you know, information on the affiliate page, but you have 17 pages that talk about doing affiliate sales and doing affiliate marketing. So it looks like a very well supported plan as well. 198 results when I just search affiliate on your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:21:38&nbsp; So yeah. So backing up a second, so who is Kinsta big component of who Kinsta is, is our blog. The way that I first learned about Kinsta was when I was working for one of our competitors, and I was in tech support and in tech support. You get these issues that you haven&#8217;t seen before a lot. Right? And so you Google, hey, here&#8217;s the error code that just got thrown at me. And you start looking through stuff. And a lot of times you go to StackOverflow and these types of sites. Now you go to AI, but back about like 6 or 7 years ago Any time I would google a WordPress issue, this one blog would keep coming up with these amazing blog posts that would not only, like, explain the issue, but walk you through how to resolve it, usually in multiple different ways. And that blog was Kinsta.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaker 5 00:22:37&nbsp; Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:22:37&nbsp; And. And so that got me. I mean again and again the same blog kept coming up with different answers for all these issues. And so eventually I was like, well, I should just go work for these guys. They seem to have it all figured out. And so I applied and I started off in the migrations team, worked my way to client experience, then to sales, and then we created this community position. But yeah, it really is amazing how much we work to give information back to, you know, the community, to the industry as a whole. Yes. It drives a lot of sales, but I mean, there&#8217;s still a ton of people I know that get value out of the blog who are not our customers. Not yet. Not yet. But your affiliate program is going to work on that for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:23:29&nbsp; That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right. Absolutely. Now, I believe this is fairly new announcement as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:23:36&nbsp; Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:23:37&nbsp; Kinsta is now a global WordCamp sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:23:40&nbsp; Yes. So this is pretty exciting. This just came out yesterday, April 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:23:45&nbsp; And it was not a joke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:23:47&nbsp; No. And it was not a joke. It was funny. We were talking about how the you know, it started April 1st, and all these reasons. And I was like, oh, do we want to hold off on doing a press release on April 1st? Probably. So it does get dismissed, but no, just really excited to again find a way to support the community through this. For those that aren&#8217;t aware, the the global WordCamp sponsors, what that means is we&#8217;re now a gold level sponsor for all of the local WordCamps around the globe. Everything except for the flagship three. And, and so that helps immediately get funding to all of those WordCamps and helps them put on those shows. It&#8217;s one less phone call that they need to make to get a sponsor signed up, and all the paperwork and rigmarole that goes through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:24:40&nbsp; So now carte blanche, we&#8217;re just all Word Camps that aren&#8217;t flagships we&#8217;re a sponsor of and so help helping get those Word Camps to happen. And then we&#8217;re also helping the Meetups happen. So there&#8217;s I don&#8217;t know the exact number at this point. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s in the thousands, if not more of Meetups around the globe. And I think these are where the the real magic happens with WordPress, right? I help run a small Meetup here in Durango once a month. We have like anywhere from 4 to 9 people show up. But every time we have great conversations and we talk about WordPress, we talk about digital marketing, we talk about how our lives are going, where we&#8217;re going to go on vacation, and we really connect. And so Meetups are just a really exciting way to really get that super local connection happening. And as a global sponsor, we help with the fees responsible for Meetup.com, which love it or hate it. you know, I&#8217;m not going to tell you my judgment right now, but it is a useful site for organizing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:25:51&nbsp; As an organizer, it makes it really easy for me to quickly get stuff posted up and then get people to come to the event. And then there&#8217;s another aspect of the Meetups that a little bit less known, apparently, because I keep on having people asking if we can help them with their venue costs. And I always ask, hey, did you reach out to WordPress Foundation yet? Because as global sponsors, we also help with the funding to help get some venue costs covered. and so that&#8217;s just really exciting to help promote both of those programs, WordCamps and Meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:35&nbsp; Absolutely. That&#8217;s awesome. and it&#8217;s really nice that there are organizations like Kinsta that, you know, are so all in on the WordPress community that you&#8217;re sponsoring, contributors. You&#8217;re sponsoring the community at large as well. I, I, I&#8217;m signing the paperwork today as one of your most recent contributors that you&#8217;re sponsoring. And I want to thank you for sponsoring my time in the WordPress community. So, yeah, I had a little snafu with signing the paperwork, as we talked about before, but it will be signed as soon as we&#8217;re done here today. So it will be official very shortly, and I&#8217;ll be able to post it on social and say how wonderful it is to have organizations like Kinsta sponsoring the work that I do in WordPress. So thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:27:21&nbsp; Well, you&#8217;re welcome. And, you know, and we&#8217;re proud to sponsor you and the other contributors because we know it&#8217;s an all volunteer project. Right? And, and it&#8217;s open source and it&#8217;s this is how open source works is the companies that are benefiting off of the projects. You know, you don&#8217;t have to write it&#8217;s open source software. So there&#8217;s no obligation to support the software. But I mean, it just makes sense that you you do realize, hey, our income is based off of these volunteer led projects. We really should be reaching out and helping to contribute in some way. And the thing I really enjoy about sponsoring contributors like yourselves Is its immediate impact, right? You&#8217;re not it. We could turn to a bunch of employees at Kinsta who have never used WordPress, let alone worked to make WordPress Slack and tried to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:28:24&nbsp; And you know that that could be very helpful for those individuals to learn more about WordPress and how to contribute to it. But as far as the project&#8217;s impact, it&#8217;s just not going to be as impactful as sponsoring people who have already been contributing, who know the ins and outs of the project, and then who can even, you know, in a force multiplier effect, help that many more people become part of the project. You know, we help a lot of people. We sponsor a lot of people that that do a lot of documentation work. And, you know, as somebody who kind of ran the documentation program at Kinsta for a little while. I mean, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s the most important work and it&#8217;s the most thankless work that can happen, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:29:10&nbsp; And it can be tedious. Right. So to have some incentive to have some to nobody does it because they&#8217;re expecting anything back. But to have a company like Kinsta to say, I see you and I want to support that as well. It&#8217;s just a wonderful thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:29:23&nbsp; Agreed, agreed. 100%. And I mean, it is tedious, right? I mean, because you&#8217;ve spent all this time putting some sort of documentation together and you miss, like, one step and that&#8217;s the first thing somebody points out to you. And so like, there&#8217;s a gut punch there. But but it&#8217;s important work. Right? And documentation is one of those things that it gets taken for granted. Right? When it&#8217;s there. You don&#8217;t think anything of the fact that somebody had to put a lot of work into creating this, but the fact that it&#8217;s there is literally allowing you to use some aspect of the tool. And so it&#8217;s so important. So important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:30:02&nbsp; Right. We&#8217;re coming up on a new release soon. We are less than two weeks away from 6.8 being released. We&#8217;re in release candidate two right now, one more week after this to work on it. And then it&#8217;s like out for for being updated. And and we do know that people find more bugs once it&#8217;s been released, but we&#8217;re in that bug squashing right now. So, and the work and, and that&#8217;s part of the work I&#8217;m doing is on that release squad. And so our others. So that&#8217;s the work that you&#8217;re supporting, not just the work that I do in the community, not just the work that I do with the photo directory, for example. But, but every release as well. So, yeah. Thank you. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:30:40&nbsp; You&#8217;re welcome. And thank you again for that work that you&#8217;re doing there, because it is really critical. And again, it&#8217;s like the documentation, WordPress can get taken for granted so easily. Because it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s just there. Right. It&#8217;s been there for we&#8217;re at like 22 years now. You just go to WordPress.org and you download the software and you can get to work on it. But there&#8217;s a lot of time and effort and people involved with making that happen. As far as 6.8&nbsp; is going. How are you feeling about it? I know that there&#8217;s been like some, you know, Matt has put out some ideas that maybe we&#8217;re going to do one release a year or something. Do you think that there&#8217;s enough people helping with testing out and and checking for bugs at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:31:29&nbsp; I mean, there are right there. There&#8217;s always people who are in there testing. We have, you know, quite a few people who are doing that kind of thing. You can always use more because we can&#8217;t test every scenario. We can&#8217;t test it against, you know, you we don&#8217;t know how it interacts with every single plugin in the world because we can&#8217;t test it on all those things. So the more people test it with those things now never, ever, ever updated on your live site please. I mean, take our word for it. That is not the right way to do it, but open it in a test environment. Use the playground to do that. Use the there&#8217;s a plugin you can use for testing. It&#8217;s all in the guidelines on the 6.8. If you go to WordPress.org /news you will see it there. the most recent release, candidate two, has all of the information to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:32:12&nbsp; so the more people I mean, I&#8217;m never going to say we have enough testers, never. So get out there and test it. If you haven&#8217;t tested it yet, we want to hear your feedback. Good, bad, ugly. We want to know because we want to make sure that what gets released on April 15th, it just happens to coincide with Tax day here in the US. What gets released on April 15th? We want it to be the best it can possibly be. And although you can never foresee everything, the more that we can take care of prior to that day, the better. Everybody will have it on release day, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:32:44&nbsp; No. Absolutely. And I, you know, I know one of the things that encourages me Kinsta we include staging environments with all of our sites. So people like, go ahead, create a staging environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:32:56&nbsp; Test it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:32:57&nbsp; Install the beta plugin and just like. Look at the site like and test it out. Are your forms working? If you have a calendar or something like that? Test everything that&#8217;s really critical for your business and make sure that it works. You know, make sure that when you fill out a form, you get the email because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:33:17&nbsp; Test it against your themes, all of those things. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And so yeah. So that&#8217;s the work that we&#8217;re doing right now. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s always something. Right? We just onboarded new a whole bunch of new photo moderators. And the queue has been sitting at zero at the end of every day. We have so many people moderating photos. We have over 20,000 photos now in the photo directory. And yeah, it used to be sometimes I would log in and be like, oh, there&#8217;s 300 to moderate. Well, let me see how many I can do in 15 or 20 minutes. Now I log in. I&#8217;m like the only ones I have to look at are the ones that are held in moderate or held as flagged. Because other people in the United States or outside of the United States can&#8217;t see those. It&#8217;s something to do with laws and things. And so usually it&#8217;s a picture of an animal. Not always. sometimes it&#8217;s things that cannot be released. Of course. for any number of reasons. But, I would say and all of the photos I have not allowed through out of the hundreds that get flagged only two. So it it&#8217;s AI driven. What gets put there versus other and AI is very conservative and so but other than that you know we just have people just getting in there and it&#8217;s all volunteer, as you said, moderating the photos under the photo directory. All of that is voluntary. So it&#8217;s a great program. Open source is great as long as people are contributing to it. And companies like Kinsta to make that a lot easier to do. So thanks for all that you do in the community. So you&#8217;re sponsoring Post Status, you&#8217;re sponsoring, globally. You&#8217;re sponsoring contributors. Goodness gracious. That&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;d love to hear that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:34:56&nbsp; Oh, well. Yeah. No, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s really exciting. It&#8217;s something that a lot of us have been pushing for, for, you know, some time and then, Yeah. No, we we realized, hey, this is a good decision to make. not just for Kinsta, but for the community. So, yeah, it&#8217;s we&#8217;re happy to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:35:14&nbsp; So any questions? I know we&#8217;ve had a couple of comments, but if you have questions, we have just a few more minutes before I let Roger go back to petting his dogs and doing his work. I will say, WordCamp Canada says “Kinsta docs and tutorials are among the best. Super useful.” I don&#8217;t know who is logged in today as WordCamp Canada, but those are lovely words that they&#8217;ve had to share with you, which is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:35:37&nbsp; Know that. Thank you. And I&#8217;ll make sure that that gets passed on to the team. We&#8217;ve got a team of we&#8217;ve got multiple full time writers on staff. Then we also do, contract people to help with writing as well. But, It&#8217;s a very full time project for us. We have in Slack. We have a content feedback channel that&#8217;s internal. But any time, like a customer lets us know and support. Hey, you know, this documentation or something is. Seems a little off. All of us at Kinsta can go into the content feedback channel and share that feedback. You know, and do our best to kind of try and help make suggestions that are helpful for the writers. But the turnaround on those is really quick, and we want to make sure that the documentation is is up to date and useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:36:29&nbsp; Sounds like a great team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: Oh, absolutely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: My my last comment is that I think only the best podcasters also have lava lamps in the background, because I have one and I see yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:36:42&nbsp; Yes. No. The lava lamp was an absolutely critical piece for the set. It&#8217;s just fun to have. It always reminds me, though, I think it was Cloudflare. Who, I don&#8217;t know if it was an April Fool&#8217;s joke post, but I remember years ago they had released something that the way that they do their random number generator is they have a series of lava lamps, and they use that for actually they scan those and then that&#8217;s how they come up with their random number generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette&nbsp; 00:37:12&nbsp; That&#8217;s funny. Claudia says “that the lava lamp is also a critical piece of equipment in her office” So. Absolutely. I don&#8217;t know if you can tell, but right in front of my lava lamp is a chicken lamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:37:23&nbsp; Okay. Just barely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:37:24&nbsp; And the egg behind, like the egg coming out of the chicken. Is the light bulb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:37:31&nbsp; Perfect, perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:37:35&nbsp; Yeah. There&#8217;s always something you can focus on in my background to talk about, that&#8217;s for sure. Anyway, anything else, go ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:37:41&nbsp; You have a great diversity background there. I&#8217;m just I&#8217;m really happy that it&#8217;s not a bookshelf of books, that that you&#8217;re trying to project that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:37:52&nbsp; I never read. No, of course I do. and I did, once upon a time play the guitar. But, those belong to my father. And I joke that when I put them on the wall, I suddenly became a developer because every developer has guitars in their background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:38:10&nbsp; Okay. All right. I didn&#8217;t know about that theory, but it does. It does seem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:38:14&nbsp; Now you&#8217;ll now you&#8217;ll notice. Now you&#8217;ll notice. I&#8217;ve we&#8217;ve also been asked here “how&#8217;s your Durango WordPress meetup going” since you are an organizer out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:38:23&nbsp; Yeah. Thank you for asking. You know, it&#8217;s going well. I think we&#8217;re now I think we&#8217;ve done eight, in a row, so consecutively, I almost dropped the ball, on this month on April&#8217;s, but, we have it. It&#8217;s happening on Friday. It&#8217;s going good. You know, organizing events for any event organizers out there, is challenging, And I feel you and you know, the Meetups are a much more simplified, simplified version of an event than like a WordCamp or something. But it does still take work, right? You need to find the venue. You need to get people to show up. You need to try and have something worthwhile to talk about while you&#8217;re there. And so, and so it&#8217;s a lot of fun. It&#8217;s also a challenge. And, I think one of the best pieces of advice somebody told me was to get co-organizers as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette00:39:19&nbsp; Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:39:20&nbsp; And I say it&#8217;s the best advice. I still don&#8217;t know if it is because I haven&#8217;t gotten any co-organizers yet, but I feel like, wow, that would probably help a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:39:30&nbsp; So it does, I promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:39:31&nbsp; Okay. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:39:32&nbsp; Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:39:33&nbsp; If anybody has any tips or tricks or advice, please feel free to reach out. Kinsta buys the lunch. So that&#8217;s a pretty cool little perk for coming. And we&#8217;ve got a really cool venue. It&#8217;s EsoTerra Cidery. They have a taproom in downtown Durango, and it&#8217;s a really wonderful venue. Lots of nice seats. They have a nice little lunch menu and they give us the space for free to use. They&#8217;re very happy to host us. So big shout out to Eso Terra. Thank you so much. They make really good cider. if that&#8217;s your jam. But no alcoholic drinks purchased for people during the lunch, by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:40:18&nbsp; Makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:40:19&nbsp; But, yeah, I think, you know, one of the challenges is coming up with topics that apply to the group as a whole, right? And so we&#8217;ll have a variety of people, from beginners to advanced WordPress users. How do we come up with topics that attract all of those people and engages all of them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:40:41&nbsp; That is the challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:40:43&nbsp; Yeah. Any advice, any tips you figured out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:40:47 Um,&nbsp; mostly I figured out to just aim for the middle, basically. And the people, you know, the people that are overqualified for that will tend to either just not come. Which is sad, but they tend to contribute to the conversation. And people who have not reached that level are still learning it. So that&#8217;s basically the best advice I could offer. Or to split, you know, and have a couple of discussions, per conversation, you know, per, per event. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:41:19&nbsp; Okay, okay. No, I like that. And I&#8217;ve kind of tracked towards that. The other thing I&#8217;ve done is I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve brought in some people from outside of WordPress a little bit to talk about like marketing and branding strategy. And really helped to expand the group and the topics a little bit. So it&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:41:38&nbsp; I even had somebody come once and talk about business insurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:41:43&nbsp; Okay. And errors and omissions. Which is a big thing for website developers. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:41:48&nbsp; Excellent, excellent. Yeah. No I and I think getting more people from the business community involved is great. Durango and I&#8217;m outside of Durango. I&#8217;m in a little town called Minkus. We&#8217;re very rural. I think Durango&#8217;s got 17,000 people. Minkus got 1200 people. And one thing that still just drives me crazy is how few local businesses have a website. even, like, even a Wix website, they don&#8217;t even have that. They&#8217;ll have a Facebook page. And, and so that it breaks my heart a little bit. You know, I want to at some point be like, hey, I&#8217;ll build your website for you, but I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m kind of not in this stage of building websites right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:42:29&nbsp; Same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:42:31&nbsp; Yeah, maybe I&#8217;ll help. Maybe I&#8217;ll help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:42:34&nbsp; Probably. and we do have, what do you call it? Justification? Vindicate. I don&#8217;t the right word. But anyway, “right about the developers having guitars in their walls. Roger could confirm he doesn&#8217;t have any on his office wall but four on another wall.” So there you go. I mean, there&#8217;s just something about it. And it&#8217;s interesting because development and ma and music go hand in hand because of the mathematical equalities to both of those. So it makes sense that somebody who is, you know, mathematically inclined, would be interested in both of those things. Chords are very math, mathematical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:43:10&nbsp; So absolutely. And maybe this explains why I&#8217;m not a good developer because I do not know how to play any music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:43:17 That&#8217;s okay. You can go to our Spotify and add some songs that you know and, and contribute musically that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:43:24&nbsp; Absolutely. Yeah. No, I love listening to music, but yeah. No, just I tried learning piano a bunch of years ago. I want to say like 12 years ago, had an instructor come to the house, got full weighted keys and everything. And, Yeah, I just couldn&#8217;t get past, like, Tinker, tinkle, tinkle a little bell or something like that. Oh, man. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:43:45&nbsp; No, I have an upright grand in my other room that I. It was my grandfather&#8217;s from the 20s, 1920s. Not not 2020. So it&#8217;s a oh, gosh, it&#8217;s over 100 years old now. My piano. But yeah. And I learned when I was little. So I don&#8217;t play very often. I live in a condo. And my neighbors would not be happy if I was banging on that piano at night, but, but it is nice to have around. So, any last any last words? Anything last things you&#8217;d like to share with us Roger?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:44:12&nbsp; you know, I it would I&#8217;d be remiss without mentioning that, we just rolled out a new product called Kinsta Automatic Updates. This is an add on feature to your website at Kinsta, and this does automatic updates of your themes and plugins, with the caveat that it does visual regression testing. So we take a screenshot before the update. We update it and then we take a screenshot afterwards if there&#8217;s a difference that means something went wrong. We revert the update and then we notify you of of which plugin caused the issue so you can start troubleshooting it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: Oh nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams: I&#8217;m really excited about that. You know, I was really excited about WordPress 6.5 when we came out with the auto rollback feature. that only catches PHP errors, which is I mean, it&#8217;s still massive. You should at least have that automatically on, I think. but with this feature, it just adds a little bit more to it. So it&#8217;ll catch, you know, maybe a plugin breaks a CSS, feature or something. And, and so the site&#8217;s not necessarily throwing up PHP error. It&#8217;s still running, but it&#8217;s broken. And if you&#8217;re spending a lot of money on your marketing and advertising, having a landing page broken is really annoying. So this helps wit that.Yeah. So if you have questions about it, come to kinsts.com and take a look to automatic updates. That&#8217;s pretty exciting. The team did a really great job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:45:34&nbsp; And if people want to follow up with you, what&#8217;s the best place to get in touch with you Roger?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roger Williams 00:45:38&nbsp; LinkedIn. I&#8217;ll be honest with you. So I&#8217;m in the Post Status group. You can DM me there. Thank you for giving me more time in Slack. But honestly, like LinkedIn, I love getting contacted there. I enjoy spending time in LinkedIn. So yeah, reach out to me there. And if you want to be on a Kinsta talk, reach out and we&#8217;ll work something out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:45:59&nbsp; Awesome. Thank you so much for your time today.

And thank you for having me on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:46:25&nbsp; My pleasure. Thank you.

Hi Cami, I know you do a lot of different things. You have your agency and all these, you know, other things, podcasting and all the things you&#8217;re doing now. But today we&#8217;re really going to talk about your web designer habits, how you came up with that, what some of them might look like, how people can get in on that, and maybe some things that we&#8217;re going to tease about what you and I are working on together too. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:00:30&nbsp; Well, that sounds great. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:33&nbsp; Yeah. Welcome to the Happiness Hour. It&#8217;s good to have you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:00:36&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s great to be here. I&#8217;m so. I&#8217;m always happy to talk to you, Michelle. Like, anytime we get to spend time together, it makes my day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:00:44&nbsp; Absolutely. I feel exactly the same way for. For people who haven&#8217;t met you, who don&#8217;t, you know, as equated with who you are. Can you just give us a little bit about where you&#8217;re located, what you do with WordPress, maybe you know anything that you want to mention about your life? I know you got a really cool dog like all those. Just fill us in on the details for a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:01:03&nbsp; Sure. Well, I am located. My name is Cami McNamara and otherwise known as Web Cami. So my business is Web Cam, LLC and I have been building websites since 2000 and started my business in 2002. So I just had my 23rd anniversary in business. Oh I&#8217;m a solopreneur. I build websites for small businesses and nonprofits all over the United States, but I&#8217;d say the majority of my clients are here in the Seattle area. So I live in Seattle, in a neighborhood called Alki Beach, and I often on social media and posting pictures of my neighborhood because, well, I just love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:01:48&nbsp; Because it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:01:49&nbsp; Thank you. I mean, it&#8217;s like I live at a California beach in a big city. So it&#8217;s kind of nice. Much smaller scale. Not not, you know, nobody&#8217;s hanging tenning out in the water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:02:03&nbsp; It&#8217;s a little chilly up there for that. Probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:02:05&nbsp; Little chilly. There&#8217;s a lot of cold plungers that, You know, I do. I did it this year on New Year&#8217;s Eve, but. Or New Year&#8217;s Day. But I&#8217;m not planning to do that again. So that&#8217;s it. I have a husband. I&#8217;ve been married for 35 years, and I have a dog who&#8217;s a ten year old Labrador named Tank. I also share a lot of pictures of him, and I have a 28 year old son.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:02:32&nbsp; Awesome. And everybody comments on the, the parking meter behind you, so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara: Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: Because I know everybody&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s the parking meter about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:02:45&nbsp; Okay so yes. Yeah. So my parking meter back here, my aunt, worked for Rockwell Industries back in the 70s. And when I was a little kid, she gave me that parking meter. Now, my grandmother had this parking meter, the same kind, but she made it into a lamp. And you&#8217;d have to put your you&#8217;d have to put coins in it to turn the lamp on. And as a as a kid, I was obsessed with that. So my aunt gave me that. You can see the faded number eight. I put like a sticker on there for my eighth birthday, and it&#8217;s there to remind me to keep my time top of mind all day long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:27&nbsp; Which is one of the web habits designer habits. But you have. So one of the things that I was just, like, enamored with when you came out with that last year, I think you called it WP Habits to begin with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:03:40&nbsp; Yeah, I called it Habits WP. I had, I had WP Habits, I still have all those domains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:03:47&nbsp; So yes, they can all point to the new one. Right. And now it&#8217;s web designer habits.com Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:03:54&nbsp; Yes. Yes because I&#8217;m really sharing habits that aren&#8217;t just for a WordPress designer. They&#8217;re really for anybody who&#8217;s doing web design and and how it came to be was, you know, I&#8217;ve been blogging about running my business for quite a while, and I wrote, I did a blog post about habits, but my friend Anne Marie and I went on a women&#8217;s business retreat with Kim Doyle in Costa Rica a couple of years ago, and I told her I want to figure out some way to share what I know and what I do, but I am not going to have time to develop big, long courses. I have a hard time taking big, long courses. What can I put? How can I put this in little tidbits for people and also for myself to work on each week? And that&#8217;s kind of how it was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:04:45&nbsp; That makes sense. I loved when you first came out with that. I signed up right away. I get the emails every week. And then I don&#8217;t you keep giving me credit for it. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s really true or not, but I was like, wow, you really have to have a whole website for this where there&#8217;s an art and archive. So like if somebody&#8217;s starting now, they can still go back and see the ones they missed. And, I kind of have a little bit more to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:05:10&nbsp; Well, it was, it was kind of always on my to do list. But you&#8217;re the person who lit the fire underneath me to go ahead and do that. And now, in addition to my website, I am building a circle community for this. So I&#8217;m hoping to have that launch in the next few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:29&nbsp; Very cool. So there&#8217;ll be a whole community about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:05:32&nbsp; Yes. Because you know what? You know, what helps you get your habits in order is having accountability with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:39&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s very true. That is very true. Do you want to bring the site up on and to share your screen? And we&#8217;ll take a look at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:05:45&nbsp; Yeah, sure. How I&#8217;m not sure how to do that, but that&#8217;s okay. Do you what do you want to do it on your end? It&#8217;s if if that&#8217;s easier for you, is it? I just haven&#8217;t been in StreamYard and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:05:59&nbsp; Yeah. That&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:05:59&nbsp; In a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:01&nbsp; Okay, so I&#8217;ve got it up. I can no longer see you, so I&#8217;m going to scroll and let you explain what we&#8217;re looking at then okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:06:06&nbsp; Well basically this is just where you sign up. and I, I like big fonts and I cannot lie. Okay. I&#8217;ll just say that right off the bat.&nbsp; So when I designed this, I really wanted it to be bold and impactful. But basically this is where you sign up. There&#8217;s just a little bit of a story about me and where, how I came to be here. I have a podcast which I have been doing, off and on for a couple of years. I share the habit each week, and then I also report on how I did adopting the habit, and that&#8217;s under the blog section. So that&#8217;s kind of new. And I&#8217;m building out resources. And as I said before, I&#8217;m going to start a circle community for this, because I just kind of feel like there&#8217;s a need for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:06:58&nbsp; And you have, you have your, WebCamiCafe over on Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:07:02&nbsp; Yes I do I started a Facebook group basically for friends that I was making as I became a GoDaddy Pro ambassador. This is back in 2018. And you know, I kept going to WOrdCamps and kept meeting people and friends of friends or adding folks, and it&#8217;s just really a nice small networking group and a good place just to meet other web designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:07:32&nbsp; Yeah, for sure. And I mean, people are posting really cool things in there all the time and asking for feedback and having great conversations about some of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:07:40&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s it because the numbers are small, it&#8217;s kind of more intimate and I really like that part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:07:48&nbsp; I did too, and I will say, like, I&#8217;m not really doing a lot of web design anymore. If I do, it&#8217;s mostly my own things that I&#8217;m, that I&#8217;m doing, you know, that kind of thing. But, I think we take this off. There we go. but I still, even though I&#8217;m not, like, web designer habit girl, finding so many of the things that you share to still be relevant, even if you aren&#8217;t a designer or a small business owner. So there are constantly reminders in there of things that I need to be doing, even if I don&#8217;t have clientele. I&#8217;m not designing for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:08:22&nbsp; Well, and and you have contributed to those things. So when I listen to you speak at WordCamp US and you instructed me to stop saying I&#8217;m sorry all the time, I felt like you were just talking to me, and I, I came back and made that a habit that everyone should adopt, because so many times we&#8217;re replying to our clients and emails and saying, oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry. And really, we&#8217;re not necessarily the ones that are sorry. It&#8217;s just comes out of your mouth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:08:55&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:08:56&nbsp; As a habit..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:08:57&nbsp; Right. There&#8217;s there&#8217;s much better language, more empowering language, stronger language you can do to help move things forward rather than just saying, I&#8217;m sorry, especially if we weren&#8217;t the ones to make the mistake or have an error kind of thing. Yeah. For sure. I also say don&#8217;t say thank you as often and and I don&#8217;t mean that as like don&#8217;t be grateful. Because certainly gratitude is something that I use all the time. But when you normally would say thank you just because that&#8217;s not a good use of thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:09:26&nbsp; Right. There&#8217;s other, more empowering language you can use, especially like when somebody buys your software and their automated emails says, thank you for purchasing XYZ. Yeah. But of course we&#8217;re grateful that they purchased it. But do they care that we&#8217;re grateful for the purchase? No. They want to know what can I do with this and how can I make my life better because of it? And so, you know, I just talk about some of those different things. So those are the things I talked about that I think you really liked at WordCamp US. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:09:50&nbsp; Yeah. No, it was fantastic. It really made a strong impression on me. And yeah, I&#8217;m always listening for things that I&#8217;m learning from other people that I know are habits I need to adopt. And selfishly, you know, creating this group is a way to keep me accountable to myself. And yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:10:11&nbsp; Yeah, for sure, I have, I actually hired an accountability coach this year. Not because I&#8217;m, you know, don&#8217;t want things to move forward, but because of ADHD brain and out of sight, out of mindedness and things like that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m writing a novel, and I want to make sure that I keep moving forward on the things that I want to keep moving forward on. And so she and I meet every other week on Zoom, and she helps me keep moving forward because I&#8217;ve only accountable to other people for their things. I&#8217;m never accountable to myself for my own things because in my brain, everybody else comes first, right? So when I have to now be accountable to her. It means I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m being accountable to me through her as a proxy, and I keep moving things forward, if that makes any sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:10:56&nbsp; Right. Yeah, it&#8217;s so true. Because, you know, we all start off our day with the best intentions, right? And we start off strong every day. And, you know, a lot of these habits that I&#8217;ve been nurturing myself. You know, the dream is to be on autopilot. Right? With some of them. And so whatever can help you, whether it&#8217;s you hiring a coach to help you, it just it just strength strengthens your resolve with you for sure thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:11:29&nbsp; It really does. And I think that it&#8217;s just a way of helping you move forward on your own projects as well, because I think, I mean, everybody does, but I, I can only speak from the women I know who talk about these kinds of things. I think as women, we always put ourselves last and we never prioritize those things. And so to have somebody help me stay accountable to listening to myself and moving myself forward, I think, became an important thing for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:11:54&nbsp; Yeah, I agree. I mean, my, my friend Anne Marie and I, we sing to each other in Marco Polo, during the week when we go on walks, just to be accountable, accountable and say, hey, it&#8217;s really cold out here, but I&#8217;m walking anyway, so I yeah, I have accountability buddies, including you all the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:15&nbsp; Yep. And and now we&#8217;ve got a third person helping us actually stay accountable to our project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:12:21&nbsp; That&#8217;s right. Because you can only imagine that it&#8217;s a little difficult for us to stay on topic when we&#8217;re meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:29&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:12:30&nbsp; Sometimes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:12:32&nbsp; For sure. So, so about that project, do you want to tease that out a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:12:37&nbsp; Right. So, Michelle reached out to me and said, hey, have you thought about doing a some sort of planner for the habits that you&#8217;re working on and and of course I it had entered my mind. But you know, I&#8217;m a solopreneur. I manage like 200 websites in my care plan. There&#8217;s just so much on my plate. And Michelle said, I have this wonderful photography and I could work in tips, and I was all in the minute she said that. So we&#8217;ve been meeting every Friday for quite a while, talking about plans, and then we brought in a friend to help us get things rolling, and we actually have a date to come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:17&nbsp; We set our first deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:13:19&nbsp; Right after. But we we have a date to come up with ideas for our layout. And both Michelle and I love planners. We already had a plethora of planners, but we both ordered a bunch to play around with and see what we liked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:13:36&nbsp; Yeah, exactly. And I made the mistake of just buying a bunch, whereas you were really strategic and went to the went to the store and took pictures of a bunch, which was yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:13:45&nbsp; I did that too, but I also I did order to you. I ordered a few like habit trackers and you know everybody. There&#8217;s also online options and notion and you know just using a Google Sheets or something like that. But I, I do think it&#8217;s it would be a fun to come up with something to accompany this material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:09&nbsp; Yeah, absolutely. Now, I think it was last week I received a, the Anti Planner in the mail and I posted it online saying, I don&#8217;t know where this came from if you sent this to me. Thank you so much. Did I tell you my confession about it? No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:14:25&nbsp; No. Did you order it and forget?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:28&nbsp; Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:31&nbsp; It was part of my Shein order. But it came separately. It didn&#8217;t say Shein. And I was like, where did this come from? And I just went over my purchase history, that I was like, well, I&#8217;ll be darned. I bought that for myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:14:43&nbsp; Oh my gosh, that&#8217;s so funny. I would do that. I would do that 100%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:49&nbsp; Anne Marie says I love the Web Designer Habits website Cami, me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:14:54&nbsp; Aw thank you Ann Marie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:14:55&nbsp; For sure. And Daveden said he watched my WordCamp US talk and needs to improve the way he overused to thank you. So yeah, I think we all kind of do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:15:04&nbsp; Yes, 100%. I&#8217;ve probably been doing that my entire life, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:15:10&nbsp; Yeah. Now I know, like I see tips all the time. I&#8217;ve written tips. I used to, you know, blog for the local newspaper, business tips, things like that. What are some of your favorite habits that either you&#8217;ve incorporated into your life or that you just think are so cool that other people should do them too? Like, do you have like 2 or 3 that you would go? I think that&#8217;s one of my favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:15:32&nbsp; Yeah. Time blocking there. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of people be very resistant to time blocking.&nbsp; And every habit doesn&#8217;t work for everyone. Right. But for me, I needed time blocking. Time blocking has been something that really shapes my day every single day. It helps me when clients send me incoming requests to say, I&#8217;m going to work on this on Wednesday at 4:00, because that&#8217;s when I have maintenance on my schedule. So I absolutely love time blocking, and that has been a huge part of me being productive as a single solopreneur. The next one is the Pomodoro technique. So I am not sitting for hours at a time because, you know, we can all get in the flow and not want to leave a project. And, I remember in the early days having all kinds of neck pain, and eye strain and everything else. It just is so important to take care of your back and everything else. And you can use the Pomodoro Technique in concert with your time blocking, and make sure that you&#8217;re stepping away and getting up every 25 minutes. So working 25 minutes with a five minute break. Yeah, works well for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:16:58&nbsp; Yeah. Now I do calendar blocking, but I, I use it to, to like, block my calendar from other people being able to schedule on my calendar just to get and not assign particular tasks, but just so I can work through my list of things that I need to do, or honestly like to sleep in a little bit on that morning if I need to. Before I was doing that, I would just say I give people my calendar links and I would wake up in the morning and I felt 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:17:26&nbsp; Yeah, you have no time. You have no time to work because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:17:28&nbsp; Yeah, I was like, what? Am I going to run to the bathroom or have lunch at that point, you know. So yeah, for sure. Oh look. Yeah, we have it&#8217;s very karmic that, Crystals got in at, the first thing he heard was the Pomodoro technique. Not the best was dealing with his ADHD most times. Trust me, we know. We know we are. We are right there with you. You are not alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:17:51&nbsp; Right? I if somebody wants to see how I time block, if you go to a WordPress TV, the WordCamp TV, site, I&#8217;m getting that wrong. But, I spoke at Vancouver 2023, Vancouver WordCamp, and I shared in my slides. My time blocking techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:14&nbsp; Oh, cool. I&#8217;ve got that right here. Hold on. I will put that in the chat. Okay. Like I&#8217;m. On it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:18:20&nbsp; Thank you for doing all the things I need to practice with StreamYard. I&#8217;m a huge fan. Now that I heard their music for testing your speakers, and anybody else who&#8217;s done that will know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:33&nbsp; I have never done that until today when you told me to do that and I was like, oh, that&#8217;s pretty cool, actually. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:18:39&nbsp; They have a whole song just about testing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:42&nbsp; You&#8217;re testing your speakers. You&#8217;re testing your speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:18:45&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty hilarious with, like, a band and everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:49&nbsp; So yeah, I know they they I&#8217;m gonna guess it&#8217;s AI generated, but even so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:18:53&nbsp; Yes. Pretty cool. It&#8217;s great. It was hilarious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:18:57&nbsp; Some of my favorite things I&#8217;ve learned is over the years, especially when I was freelancing and I could write off so many of my expenses was to keep an envelope in my car with the month listed on it. So if it was, you know, March, I had that envelope either in my purse or in my car. So that like whenever I was shopping, picking up things, I would put the receipts in there. For that month so that I could then at the end of the month, tally things up, keep track of it. And when it came to tax time, I wasn&#8217;t going where all the receipts and what did I do and how much money. And I was a step ahead or two steps ahead of the game at that point in time. So that was one that I really liked. The other thing that I have taught myself recently, so we&#8217;ll see if it hangs on as I habit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:19:40 I have a tendency like throughout the day I as I&#8217;m on calls, I make little notes. And now at the end of the day, instead of just having this giant pile of notes, I&#8217;m transcribing them into action items and keeping track of them in my little like method of how I&#8217;m trying to keep on top of tasks. So I don&#8217;t know what was that I had to do? And where is that piece of paper? And I can&#8217;t read my handwriting and all those things so that while it&#8217;s still fresh in my mind, I&#8217;m translating things into tasks because otherwise things fall through the cracks. And I&#8217;m not a fan of letting things fall through the cracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:20:12 Yeah, that&#8217;s a great plan. You know, it&#8217;s kind of like at the end of every day, I&#8217;m always thinking, what promises did I make today? Right? And yeah, it&#8217;s a it&#8217;s a very helpful to get all your tasks actually on your calendar too. So you got the tasks and you have them scheduled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:20:33&nbsp; Yes. Yes, exactly. And I discovered today that my, Google calendar was not able to send me those two minute warnings before an event happened, and I was running late to everything because I was relying on those before. And so I was able to troubleshoot that today. And now I&#8217;m getting notifications on my calendar. So sometimes you just have to dig in and figure out what&#8217;s wrong and how to fix it, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:20:58&nbsp; Right. And you know, we get so involved in our day to day that if you don&#8217;t get that ping right before something happens, you can completely forget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:21:07&nbsp; Yes, exactly. Now, one of the things that you do as an agency is you actually have care plans. And how many websites are you caring for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:21:17&nbsp; Over 200 a month. And, you know, I, I incrementally built that over time. It&#8217;s been ten years, so I didn&#8217;t go from 0 to 200. I have it down. I use I, I use Managed WP. It&#8217;s a tool that I&#8217;ve been using since the beginning of time, I feel like, and it is such a great tool for me because I can start my day and is the only person in my business. The first thing I log into every day is Manage WP, and it&#8217;s the last thing I leave at the end of every day because it&#8217;s my control panel for getting to those client sites in a hurry. It also is like, you know, it&#8217;s not just for the client. The client. I love that they trust me to take care of their websites. They are doing me a favor because if they have an emergency, it doesn&#8217;t disrupt my life entirely to help them. Because I have what I need to help them versus leaving it up to them to have a backup. And oops, I figured out I wasn&#8217;t really making backups the whole time. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times that&#8217;s happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:22:27&nbsp; Oh, I can imagine. And you&#8217;re also still designing at the same time. So taking on new clients and doing all the work to keep the business going, which is why those habits are so important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:22:37&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m in a networking group, and I took a couple of years off because my parents passed away and I just got back into it in September. So every Thursday morning I&#8217;m going to an in-person meeting. I have kind of some duties as a person in the group. I meet with other people. It&#8217;s but it brings in a steady flow of business. So yes, it&#8217;s I&#8217;m spinning plates all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:23:04&nbsp; What is a habit that you would think would be helpful for people who work alone remotely? Like like me. Right. I&#8217;m in my house 24/7, basically, unless I&#8217;m going out meeting somebody for dinner to go shopping. So I work here. I try to meet people online, have that kind of personal touch here and there. What would your suggestion be for like online networking and things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:23:26&nbsp; Well, I would, join some online groups, you know, I&#8217;ll mention Admin Bar. That&#8217;s a really good one to get, kind of like a really big, vast. It&#8217;s it&#8217;s huge. Right. But you get a lot of different types of web designers in there to connect with a group like mine. Web Cami Cafe, smaller. Anybody who&#8217;s just starting out is welcome to join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:23:51&nbsp; But you can also join groups that, are just interests that you have that aren&#8217;t directly web designers, but it might be another tool that you use, like I&#8217;m in the Beaver Builder group, because that&#8217;s the tool that I use, and I, I&#8217;m just interacting with people as important. It&#8217;s actually a line item. It&#8217;s a time block for me to go online and log into all the places I&#8217;m a member of and actually participate and answer a question, or give somebody a like or a heart, and that gets you some exposure. But really, I do think that, networking in your local area because nothing really takes the place of human to human contact. So tonight I was going to a Women in Marketing networking event. It&#8217;s been canceled because we&#8217;re supposed to have severe weather tonight by a little crazy, but getting out of your office and and interacting with people. And even if you&#8217;re an introvert in a small way, it can really just boost your spirits. Like you might dread it before you go. But after it&#8217;s over, I guarantee you you&#8217;ll feel good about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:07&nbsp; And Zach mentions don&#8217;t forget Post Status for the events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:25:09&nbsp; Yes of course Post Status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:12&nbsp; We have lots of good conversations in there too. Of course. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s great. I love, I personally I love getting together with people, even if it&#8217;s online. And one of the things, like one of the ways you and I grew our friendship was I was like, does anybody want a coworker during Covid? And you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;ll do it. And like, that was our first really, like face to face, if you will, even though it was virtual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:25:32&nbsp; And let&#8217;s just admit we didn&#8217;t work at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:36&nbsp; No, not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:25:38&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t work at all. And we met, in a WordCamp that was online, fully online. I don&#8217;t remember if it was WordCamp Europe or, but it was fully online. And GoDaddy had me working in their virtual booth, and that&#8217;s how it might have been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:25:55&nbsp; Might have been Denver, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:25:57&nbsp; Or, San Antonio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:00&nbsp; Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:26:01&nbsp; Yeah, that one was one of the first ones to go online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:04&nbsp; Yeah, that could have been. Yeah, for sure. It&#8217;s so hard to remember five years ago. Yeah. And yet and yet it&#8217;s hard to forget five years ago too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:26:11&nbsp; Yes.I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:12&nbsp; And it&#8217;s funny because I&#8217;ve recently seen these memes like, you know, like five years ago today, which was, you know, on March 13th. And I was like, what happened five years ago today? And then I was like, oh, wait, that was like lockdown.&nbsp; I remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:26:23 I, I was flying home, I was visiting my folks in Northern California and I was flying home. And it was surreal because they had just closed down Seattle, like I was coming home and like everything was going to be closed. And, I like they they were spacing people on the airplane. So you weren&#8217;t seated next to people. And that was just bizarre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:26:47&nbsp; It was so surreal. It felt like ghost towns and like you could walk down the middle of Main Street and like, like an old Western, like draw, you know? Yeah, you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:26:56&nbsp; Did all of it because I, I flew home like 20 times during Covid, and there were times when you would get off the plane at the airport. There was nobody there. Everything was closed. It was just like, walk right through it is. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:27:10&nbsp; Really insane for sure. Anybody in the in the who&#8217;s watching right now, do you have a web habit that you&#8217;ve developed as a web designer or agency owner, or just in business in general that you think you&#8217;d like to share? Maybe Cami will put it in one of her newsletters. I mean, with your permission, of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara: Yes, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: Because I I&#8217;d love to hear what some people have. So get typing in those comments, we want to hear what some of your habits are. I right now am laid off from a full time job, and one of the things that I have been maintaining as a habit is getting up every day and coming to my desk and doing something at my desk that I don&#8217;t break that you know, continuity of sitting at my desk and doing work. And so I, with the exception of one day that I took off to do something else, but family oriented. But I sit here every day. Some days I&#8217;m done at two. Some days I&#8217;m done at seven. It depends on what I&#8217;m working on and what meetings I have and those kinds of things. But it is actually pretty exciting to think about continuity that way. And so even if you aren&#8217;t working full time or you have a day that you, you know, you don&#8217;t have other, obligations getting up and sitting at your desk and, you know, making that commute down the hall, as I always say, I think is another habit to really be in. So, oh, here we go. Anne Mary says she learned from you to check email three times a day. Because checking emails constantly is a really bad habit of hers. Which, yeah, for sure, I&#8217;m. I have my phone in my pocket all the time, so I try to set it aside with notifications off when I&#8217;m at my desk, because otherwise I will react to every notification. So 100%, that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:28:56&nbsp; Yeah. That&#8217;s one of the habits that is never going to be an autopilot for me. I, I have to fight my urge to check my email all day to get that done. And I&#8217;ve even put a tab on my Gmail that is called focus. It&#8217;s like an empty inbox that I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:29:15&nbsp; Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:29:15&nbsp; I put that up so I&#8217;m not looking when I shouldn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:29:19&nbsp; Yeah. Nope. I get that, Zach has one too. I set aside time to learn, time to create, time to focus on getting work done and time to handle operations every day. It sounds like that time blocking you were talking about whether it&#8217;s the same time every day, just making sure that you&#8217;re hitting all those marks and continuing moving everything forward in a regular fashion. I think that&#8217;s a great idea, Zach, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:29:41&nbsp; Yeah, I, I totally agree with Zach. I even have like, my wake up block at the beginning of my day. And and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s for me to wake up, shower, exercise, and I put whatever. So if one day I don&#8217;t want to wake up and I just want to sleep until, you know, 7:30 or whatever, I can. It never happens. But I could like, you know, my time block. I would allow it. It&#8217;s flexible. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:30:10&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, for sure. I, I, I made a decision earlier this week that made me so happy and that, like, my calendly links have been set from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and I hate 9:00 meetings. So I was like, why do I have that on my calendar then? So I went in and changed my calendly to start at ten in the morning instead, because I it&#8217;s my calendar, I can do what I want with it. So if I don&#8217;t want 9:00 meetings, I don&#8217;t have to have a 9:00 meeting. And it&#8217;s like, why did I not think of that before? Like, how silly, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:30:43&nbsp; Yeah, I, I use the time blocking in two ways. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m blocking the time that, that I need to work and I&#8217;m available for appointments. And over the years I have really shrunk those hours that I&#8217;m available for appointments down to. I think it&#8217;s about 6.5 hours a week now. That&#8217;s it. And, but if I don&#8217;t do that, then I am working constantly on weekends and after hours because I don&#8217;t have enough time in my day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:31:13&nbsp; So Zach doesn&#8217;t start appointments till 11 because this morning are for creativity, which I think is perfect. Yeah. So I know go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:31:22&nbsp; Another another way to do that is to make one day all appointments, and I do that as well. And it&#8217;s exhausting, but it kind of frees up the other days for me to not have me. Yeah, all of them. You know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:31:35&nbsp; Sometimes it&#8217;s hard. So like, this month I&#8217;ve been doing all of these, like over 50, 5 minute interviews with women all over the world. And so I&#8217;ve had my calendar running from anywhere from nine in the morning until 7 or 8:00 at night, because I&#8217;ve been interviewing with women from Uganda and with women from Asia and women from Australia, and like complete opposite timezones of me. So I&#8217;ve tried to be a little more, gracious with the time available to make sure that I can represent women all over the world, and not just in my convenient to my convenience. Right? So, so sometimes, sometimes it&#8217;s a little more challenging for sure, but that&#8217;s finite, right? So that&#8217;s not going to go on forever. And no. And and so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:32:16&nbsp; You have to have flexibility because we all have those things. We have those clients that can&#8217;t meet during the times we&#8217;re available. So we&#8217;re not going to say, I can&#8217;t meet with you ever. You&#8217;re going to adjust, and then you steal that time from wherever you took it from. So if a client enters something that is supposed to be work time for me, I&#8217;m going to reach out in the future and and close off meeting time to make up for it. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:32:44&nbsp; And I have so I have my regular Calendly slots available. And I have a secret calendar that somebody is on the other side of the world are like, oh, I can&#8217;t make any of those times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:32:53&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be like, well, this calendar work for you? And it&#8217;s got more expensive, but it isn&#8217;t available to everybody all the time. So I try to yeah, little little tricks that kind of work for me here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:33:02&nbsp; Yeah. The Calendly secret meeting is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:33:06&nbsp; Yeah it is. And Ann Marie says she blocks off Fridays. No meetings that day. It is freeing. Absolutely. For sure. Zach, are you the Zach that joined the. Oh, I guess we don&#8217;t need to put that up there. You can just respond to that one. Claudia says she has a secret scheduler too. Very helpful. Absolutely. And it feels almost clandestine. Right. Like you&#8217;ve got this. Like, nobody knows about this unless I bring them into the fold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:33:34&nbsp; I feel a new habit coming along right here. I think that that would be a great I mean, you know, think about yourself as a web designer. And you&#8217;re just starting out, and a lot of these things, like setting up secret meetings and stuff, these are things we learn over time, right? Like, I didn&#8217;t always have the secret meeting thing. And then once I started using Calendly more, you know, on the regular backup, it&#8217;s been 5 or 6 years or something way before Covid. But it just really was like, wow, this is cool. You know, I like, I like, had a calendar for happy hours. Oh, yeah. You know, before Covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:34:17&nbsp; Sure. Yeah. And I&#8217;ve learned, like, I for my WPCoffeeTalk. I have only one evening and and Saturday is available. And if I know I want to sleep in on a certain Saturday, I just block that day on my calendar. I just want block and then people can&#8217;t schedule for that week, but for that week. And it doesn&#8217;t have to be right away. People can schedule for next month or, you know, a few weeks out or that kind of thing. So I&#8217;m not. Nothing is urgent when you&#8217;re recording a podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:34:43&nbsp; Yeah. And and that&#8217;s the other thing about scheduling, like online scheduling, is I usually make sure there&#8217;s like a 12 hour buffer between when somebody can book with me so I don&#8217;t get a, you know, I might start my when I start my day, I know what my schedule is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:34:59&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want people to just be hopping in there in turn, like a one meeting day into a five meeting day all of the sudden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:35:07&nbsp; Yeah. Zach says he also has a schedule that isn&#8217;t as lockdown for VIPs. I&#8217;m assuming. Zach, that&#8217;s the link you give me? Just asking. can I give you another habit I developed this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:35:19&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:35:20&nbsp; Which is I mostly travel for business to this point and occasionally for fun. I actually have a whole kit of things that I keep in my suitcase. Duplicates of things like I have, you know, my toiletries bag. And I have duplicate minis of all the toiletries so I don&#8217;t have to take things from my bathroom and push back and forth. So I keep that in there. I keep a little, extension cord in there, and I keep my international plugs in there so that an extra watch charger, like all of the things, extra phone charger, so that I don&#8217;t have to make that list every time I travel. I have all those regulars already in the suitcase.&nbsp; All I really have to do is anything specific to that trip and my clothes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:36:03&nbsp; Oh, that&#8217;s a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:36:06&nbsp; It&#8217;s a huge time saver, huge time saver. And it saves me from forgetting things like Tylenol or, you know, those kinds of things because it I I&#8217;ve arrived places before with a horrible headache and don&#8217;t have any Tylenol with me. And then I have to go in search of in a foreign city that I don&#8217;t know, and find some Tylenol or pay at the airport ten times what Tylenol costs, you know, those kinds of things. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:36:32&nbsp; Yeah, travel hacks, that&#8217;s a whole nother that other a lot of great, great tips for that. When I was going to California a lot, to see my folks, I had like a hanging toiletry bag. And in the morning when I was getting ready, that&#8217;s when I was packing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:36:49&nbsp; So, yeah, that&#8217;s a good idea too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:36:50&nbsp; That was kind of a nice, streamlined, streamlined way to take care of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:36:56&nbsp; Absolutely. But I have just purchased extra plug, you know, power strips and things that I can plug all my things into for charging overnight in a hotel room. I have enough of those that I keep one in the suitcase, so it just makes me happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:37:09&nbsp; Well, I know when I see you in Arizona in about 3 or 4 weeks that, that&#8217;s going to be how you&#8217;re rolling in. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:37:17&nbsp; Exactly. All ready ready. That&#8217;s right. So. Oh, and Zach says, you know that his camera bag is go ready at all times, as is mine. Zach, I made the mistake once of not charging batteries, and I got an hour and a half away, and I had no batteries charged, and I was like, well, it&#8217;s a pretty drive, but the birds aren&#8217;t going to be photographed today because I forgot to charge things. So. Yeah. Claudia has a bag of stuff in the car all the time. Yeah, I have a little purse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:37:43&nbsp; Good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:37:44&nbsp; A little mini pair of sewing scissors in my car. Because, like, when I get a Starbucks or something, the hole is never big enough to actually, like, drink through. You know how, like, you have to have that second hole. Yeah. So I&#8217;m like, poke it through with an extra pair of scissors, because I made the mistake of using a pen once and ended up with ink in my coffee, which I don&#8217;t recommend to anybody. But yeah, if lip balm in my car I have that. I have a nail file and clippers and things that you wish you had when you suddenly go broke a nail. What am I going to do now? You know, kinds of things. So great advice. All great advice though. Oh, I love it. All the tips and tricks from people in the in the comments too, any last minute before we start to wrap things up here, folks, if you&#8217;ve got any other ideas, throw them in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:38:25&nbsp; Also, if you have any questions, you know, we want to, we want to hear them. Please put those in the comments as well. If you have a question for Cami or me, panic-mode is the go to before travels. Yeah, I&#8217;m a last minute packer, which is also why I have those things packed in advance. Because otherwise I&#8217;d be like, oh, I forgot my toothpaste and oh, where&#8217;s my toothbrush and all those things. So I just have. I mean, you can own more than one toothbrush. Did you know that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:38:56&nbsp; Yeah. I will get my I will get my suitcase out a few days early and just start throwing things at it. It&#8217;s not packed, but it&#8217;s a pile. And I just. Then, then the night before. That way, if I&#8217;m doing laundry, I can just. Put tuff in there. Yeah. Fold it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:39:14&nbsp; Yeah. Anker makes a USB-C charger hub that can charge up to four devices, including a laptop. Oh, that&#8217;s a great idea. I had something like that, and it got confiscated in Seoul, so I lost that. It was in my suitcase. They told me I could go all the way down to baggage claim and back up through security. Or I could toss that $30 charger. And I said, go ahead and throw it away. So, yeah, don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s another thing. Don&#8217;t pack things in your suitcase that can&#8217;t travel. Good advice. yeah. Any last minute thoughts Cami anything that you wished I&#8217;d asked you or that you want to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:39:50&nbsp; You know, I just believe that if you can make a tiny change every day and it helps you run your business better, that, you know, that is sometimes we just get so bogged down with what we should be doing or, you know, maybe we want to make a change and it seems too daunting and just breaking things down into tiny little, increments that you can deal with. And that goes for like a task, like a redesign.&nbsp; If you&#8217;re feeling overwhelmed, just do one little thing. If you only work on it for 30 minutes today, consider it a win. So celebrate all the little things that you do</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:40:30&nbsp; Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:40:30&nbsp; That makes a difference and help you make it through your day. So often we just don&#8217;t give ourselves enough credit and can be too critical of ourselves and how our day goes. Nobody has a perfect day, you know? Maybe. I mean, and if you have one, you&#8217;re not going to have one the next day. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:40:50&nbsp; That&#8217;s true. You seldom get two in a row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:40:52&nbsp; That&#8217;s. Yeah. You seldom get two in a row and just, you know, whatever you do, some days if you have a bad day, you know, maybe you needed the day off. And just in that instance, you&#8217;re taking care of yourself. And that&#8217;s a good day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:41:07&nbsp; Absolutely. Do you have your, your celebration jar there on your desk still?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:41:11&nbsp; So I do, but I emptied it today because it got so. It got so full then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette: Oh that&#8217;s awesome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara: I had yeah like it got really full. But yes, I put little post-it notes in here with what I accomplished. Just one little task at a time and I keep it. Normally I empty it on Friday, but I&#8217;ve been, I&#8217;ve been go I, I kind of worked a little on Sunday, so. Got full early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:41:36&nbsp; Yeah. Zach says the best process for writing down your systems is to have the people doing the work write the SOP. Yeah, that&#8217;s true too. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:41:46&nbsp; Well, that would be me I the person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:41:49&nbsp; Yeah, a lot of us, it&#8217;s just ourselves for sure. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:41:52&nbsp; But yes, I do agree that, like, having those things written down that you do is just a fantastic way to kind of map out what, what you going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:42:03&nbsp; And they&#8217;re all written down at WebDesignerHabits.com. How is that for a Segway? That was pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cami MacNamara 00:42:08&nbsp; That was pretty awesome.

You know, it isn&#8217;t complex. It&#8217;s just like one thing. I don&#8217;t look it up a whole bunch of other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette 00:42:38&nbsp; I mean, that makes it easy to read, right? So it&#8217;s easy to consume for sure, which has one of the reasons I love it. And if it doesn&#8217;t apply to me, that&#8217;s okay. I still learn something. and if it does, great. Yeah.

It&#8217;s unbelievable that it&#8217;s already <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/counter/\">been downloaded over 6 million times as I write this</a>. That feeling never gets old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a funny time in WordPress because there are a lot of  really interesting open questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Can we iterate faster with canonical plugins?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What&#8217;s the fun thing we can put in to celebrate 7.0, and when will that be? (I was rooting for real-time co-editing like Notion/Canva/Google Docs.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can we use AI to automate our manual work around WordPress.org?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can AI help us make 60k+ open source plugins and themes in the directory more secure? (I think so.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What should we do with our 13k issue backlog? (That&#8217;s a lot of bug gardening.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How will AI change how people build and update sites?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Just like RSS and web standards supercharged WordPress for the podcasting and search revolutions, what standards or APIs can we ship to help 40%+ of the web work with AI agents? (Plus an entire rabbit hole of all the new sloppy crawlers using so many resources.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these broad changes are mixed. At one point, I used Google to search for things and would visit their top result, which is great for website owners. Nowadays, Google pulls almost everything I need into the results page, so I don&#8217;t see as many random sites. But on <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a>, sometimes I&#8217;ll read the answer and then visit 4-5 of the sources it cites to learn more, so I&#8217;m visiting 4-5x more random websites, usually powered by WordPress, than I would have even in the early days of Google. We don&#8217;t know how this all plays out yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These questions are also against the backdrop of some of the brightest minds in WordPress spending more time with legal code than computer code, which could last until 2027 or longer with appeals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking for myself, I was in my first deposition today. I really appreciated the due process and decorum of the rule of law, and just like code, law has a million little quirks, global variables, loaded libraries, and esoteric terminology. But wow, after a full day of that, I&#8217;m mentally exhausted. Hence, I&#8217;m posting about 6.8 after it&#8217;s had 6 million downloads. I&#8217;m more impressed than ever by what smart lawyers do, and the entire thing, though sometimes imperfect and frustrating, is a blessing to our democracy. However, I can&#8217;t wait to return to spending the plurality of my days with engineers and designers again. I&#8217;m sure many other folks in the WordPress community would agree.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:19:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"bbPress: bbPress 2.6.13 is out\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://bbpress.org/?p=244192\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://bbpress.org/blog/2025/04/bbpress-2-6-13-is-out/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:513:\"<p>bbPress 2.6.13 is a <strong>minor</strong> release that fixes <a href=\"https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.6.13\">1 small incompatibility</a> with WordPress 6.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(This fix is already merged into the 2.7 development branch.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to vortfu, peterwilsoncc, spacedmonkey, joemcgill, swissspidy, and jorbin for helping communicate this to the bbPress team <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/1f41d.png\" alt=\"🐝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:57:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"John James Jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: #165 – Aaron D.

The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, why open standards matter, and how WordPress fits into an open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:53] Nathan Wrigley: If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Aaron D. Campbell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron is an international speaker, open source advocate, and self-described outgoing introvert. He&#8217;s been a regular contributor to WordPress for more than a decade, and is currently director of product at A2 Hosting. His longstanding enthusiasm for WordPress stems from its role as a necessary counterbalance to closed web solutions, providing a vital, open source, alternative that fosters accountability among digital platforms. Aaron&#8217;s vision of WordPress&#8217;s importance has fueled his sustained commitment, and excitement for the platform matching his initial zeal from years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we talk about a topic that&#8217;s integral to Aaron, and likely resonates with many of you listeners, the importance of the open web. With the advent of closed platforms, open standards and open source have become more crucial than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron shares his journey in the WordPress space, and how his commitment to the open web has kept him passionate about it over the years. We discussed the evolution of open web concepts, maintaining interoperability, and ensuring your digital creations remain under your control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We compare this with the growing dominance of closed corporate platforms, and examine the impact of profit motives versus the more altruistic goals of open source. Aaron articulates why preserving the openness of the web is essential, not just for innovation, but for the entire fabric of global society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the role of open systems and the future they shape and why the open web matters now more than ever, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Aaron D. Campbell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Aaron D. Campbell. Hello, Aaron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] Aaron D. Campbell: Hey, thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] Nathan Wrigley: Well, I&#8217;m really pleased to talk to you today. This is a subject which is fairly close to my heart. We&#8217;re going to approach it, first of all, from the non WordPress angle, and then we&#8217;ll get into it from the WordPress angle. It&#8217;s all about open standards, open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess before we begin, Aaron, I&#8217;ll just explain that this is the first interview that I&#8217;ve done at WordCamp Asia, which is in Manila. How are you finding it here? Did you have a nice journey over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:36] Aaron D. Campbell: You know, my journey over was smooth and uneventful, which is exactly how I like my journeys to these things to be. And I&#8217;m finding the place to be fantastic, and the time zone change to be very difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly my experience as well. I think we&#8217;re both fairly tired at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the first day, it&#8217;s Contributor Day, so there&#8217;ll be all of that excitement later. Aaron&#8217;s doing a presentation at WordCamp Asia, and this is what we&#8217;re going to talk about. It&#8217;s called The Future, why Open Web Matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into that, Aaron, do you just want to give us your little potted bio? Tell us why you are here, who you work for, what it is that you do in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:13] Aaron D. Campbell: Sure, yeah. What do I do in the WordPress space? Well, that has changed a lot over the years, but I&#8217;ve been pretty actively contributing to the WordPress project for about 18 or so years now. Done everything from leading releases and leading the security team to helping put on some of these events like WordCamp US. I work for A2 Hosting, focusing on our products and helping to align what we do with the kind of open web, WordPress ethos that I have at my core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:44] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just ask you, if you&#8217;ve been in the project for as long as you have, which is pretty much the length of the whole project, I think, 18 years or so. But basically you&#8217;ve been in it since the beginning. So it&#8217;s nothing to do with the topic at hand. Are you as excited about WordPress as a thing in 2025 as you were all those years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] Aaron D. Campbell: Yes. Yes I am. I think that the thing that has kept me around this long, it&#8217;s not easy to do a thing for, you know, going on almost 20 years and to stay excited about it. But I think that the thing that has kept me there is this whole open web concept, and that I see WordPress as a very important counterbalance to some of the closed solutions that exist on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a viable alternative that is open helps keep those other platforms accountable, if you will. And so I think that what&#8217;s kept me around is really that kind of idealistic thing that I have around how important WordPress is. And so, yes, I&#8217;m just as excited about it as I was back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:47] Nathan Wrigley: It feels like, if we were to rewind the clock 18 years ago, it feels like open was more normal, perhaps than it is now. And I think the closed platforms have monetised their way into the web and have kind of become, in many ways, the default, especially for people who aren&#8217;t in the inner circle of open source projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, the way to carry out messaging online is to go to a closed platform. The way to communicate via email is to use close, well, the protocol&#8217;s open, but you know, the system that you might use may be closed, and so on and so forth. So that seems to be the default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, let me just read the blurb from your presentation so we&#8217;ll get a flavor of what it is that Aaron will be talking about out. So we&#8217;re talking about why the open web matters. And the blurb that went with that goes as follows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet has revolutionised how we share information, enabling unprecedented collaboration, and accelerating human progress in ways once unimaginable. However, this powerful tool is now at a crossroads. In this talk, Aaron will explore the critical role that open systems and the open web play in shaping our future. He will delve into the potential consequences of a closed digital ecosystem, and argue why preserving the openness of the web is essential, not only for innovation, but the very fabric of our global society. Discover why the open web matters more now than ever, and what&#8217;s at stake if we lose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s some fairly powerful words in there, you know, the future of society and so on. However, underpinning it all is this phrase, open web. And it occurs to me that, dear listener, you may not know what that means. So my opening gambit to you Aaron, what is the open web? What does that even mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:20] Aaron D. Campbell: Honestly, you were talking a little bit about how we see more of these closed platforms now, and maybe it was more the standard 18, 20 years ago, and it&#8217;s true. When the web started around 1991, it was open in that information flowed easily and freely back and forth. And the things that we used to interact with the web, HTTP, HTML, all these things that we use were these open standards that could be implemented by anyone. You could implement them in some sort of closed web browser. You could implement them in an open source web browser. Either way, they were open standards that you could implement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that that, where we started is kind of the core of this open that I&#8217;m talking about. It&#8217;s the interoperability, the ability for things to work together for different companies to be able to give you that same experience that you might want to have with their flavor. But if you then choose to leave that company, you can go somewhere else and still have whatever it is that you built, or created, or were using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so open, while I love open source and a lot of what I do is around open source, I don&#8217;t think that open source in and of itself is the open web. It&#8217;s more about this freedom to be able to own your stuff and take it wherever you want to take it. It&#8217;s that interoperability that&#8217;s really at the core of open when I&#8217;m talking about the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:48] Nathan Wrigley: So it&#8217;s kind of the ability to pick up your data from one spot. Let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;ve got, well, in the case of WordPress, you&#8217;ve got a blog, you&#8217;ve got content that you&#8217;ve created, text, images and so on. The ability to say, you know what? I&#8217;m fed up with my CMS of choice. I want to move it elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the same would be the case for, okay, I&#8217;ve got a bunch of messages that I&#8217;ve written to some clients and to some friends. I want to be able to drop that platform and move it over here. So I guess email might be a good example there. You know, there&#8217;s the protocol behind the email, that&#8217;s completely open. It would be crazy if you could only email people who are using the same service that you had. And so you can move providers all the time, but you may not be able to move your email address. So it&#8217;s a sort of complicated picture, but transportability, yeah. Is that possibly it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] Aaron D. Campbell: Yeah. I think that your example of, I&#8217;m fed up with my CMS, so I want to go somewhere else. That&#8217;s valid, I guess. But I look at it more from, let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re a company that sells leather goods, and wherever you have your website has decided that they no longer allow you to sell leather goods on their platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to go somewhere else for your own livelihood. You need to be able to go somewhere else. Can you? And if your site is WordPress, and it&#8217;s your host that says, we no longer allow leather goods, you can just move somewhere else. But if your site is on Facebook, and Facebook says that you can&#8217;t do that anymore, you can&#8217;t just take what you have and move somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a big difference because that&#8217;s a thing that is key to you continuing to, you know, I don&#8217;t know, run your business, make your money, put food on your table. And so it&#8217;s not just like, I got sick of this tool and wanted to move to another one. I think that part of it is like, who has control, and what are your options if what they want no longer aligns with what you want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] Nathan Wrigley: So it really boils down, in your case, to the ability for you to choose where things end. Yeah, choice. A choice. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really haven&#8217;t ever read a history of the internet, but the bits and pieces, the impression that I&#8217;ve got over the years when I&#8217;ve been reading around how the internet began, CERN and ARPANET and those kind of things. When the internet began, I don&#8217;t really know what the enterprise was to begin the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it felt like it was more or less a service to provide the capability for academics to communicate with each other. There was never this intention that, okay, we&#8217;ll be buying and selling goods online. We&#8217;ll all be communicating through messaging platforms online. We&#8217;ll be sending photos online. So how did the internet begin? Do you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:20] Aaron D. Campbell: It began open and it began specifically for the purposes of sharing information. The commercial internet exchange was trying to connect all these big networks that had tons of information in them at places like universities, governmental agencies, right? That were these silos of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wanted to interconnect those networks, make the internet, be able to share data back and forth for the purposes of being able to learn from each other. It was very much an academic pursuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that&#8217;s kind of how we grow our knowledge as people, right? We learn from what other people have learned, and then we learn some more on top of that. And they saw the value of having this kind of connected digital network to share information. And it was only useful if it was open, and that information could flow back and forth freely. And so, yes, you&#8217;re right, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be a commercial endeavor. It was meant to be a knowledge sharing endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s kind of a really altruistic enterprise when you say it in those terms. It really feels like it&#8217;s for the betterment of humanity. But I&#8217;m sure all of us can imagine scenarios where we think about our use of the internet, and the words, betterment of humanity are just not, well, they&#8217;re just an anathema.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, you know, the internet has undoubtedly caused harms in various ways, and there&#8217;s misinformation being spread and all sorts of things like that, problems that we&#8217;ve got online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m wondering, well, if we were talking about open on all levels of the internet, so for example, the internet that I&#8217;m using, I&#8217;m using a CMS, a web browser. It&#8217;s HTTPS, CSS, JavaScript, those kind of things. But underpinning it all, here&#8217;s my Mac, and the Mac presumably talks to the TCP IP stack, and there&#8217;s a bunch of routers and all of those kind of things going on, holding the internet together. Does all of that stack need to be open, or is it okay for some bits and pieces holding the infrastructure together to be closed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I&#8217;m not sure that you&#8217;d kind of want the hardware layer, if you know what I mean, some of those bits and pieces. Maybe they need to be, well, maybe they need to be proprietary and closed. I don&#8217;t know. What are your thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:27] Aaron D. Campbell: That&#8217;s a really intriguing question, and I think that for the purposes of just being able to use and enjoy and leverage the internet, no, all those layers do not need to be open. For the purposes of preserving the internet as this information sharing kind of altruistic tool, I think that there needs to be openness at every one of those levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that, for example, you were talking about the routers that shift all the information around, and they&#8217;re largely these hardware things, although they do have some software on them. But do all of those need to be open? No. But if one company is the only one that&#8217;s capable of shifting information around the web, then it becomes a problem. So as long as there are viable open alternatives, and some are closed and some are open, great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t want any company, no matter who it is, you know, in this case maybe a, Cisco is maybe the biggest router company, right? I don&#8217;t want them to be the only one in control of what information can be sent back and forth across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:31] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. I think our conversation is probably going to dwell on the information layer, the bit at the top. So the text that we send and, you know, the images, and the CMS and so on. Now, in the beginning of your presentation, there was a phrase which stuck out because you said, we&#8217;re in a time of unprecedented collaboration, and accelerating human progress is what the internet is kind of all about. It&#8217;s a fairly lofty phrase and I was wondering what you meant by that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:59] Aaron D. Campbell: So first of all, the internet allows for a kind of collaboration that we&#8217;ve never seen before in history, right? Like, collaboration, we all hop on these Zoom calls all the time and think nothing of the fact that I am in an instant virtual video call with people in eight different countries. But that&#8217;s possible. I literally do that almost every single day. People on my team are in the UK, they&#8217;re in Bulgaria, that&#8217;s normal. That was not normal 20 years ago. It was certainly not normal, I guess, what, 40 years ago, pre-internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a level of collaboration that can happen now that just never was able to before. And we see that in tons of places. My wife&#8217;s neurologist, I think I gave you this example in some notes that I sent over. She collaborates with neurologists all over the world, live, almost daily. And that&#8217;s mind boggling. But the fact that a neurologist can immediately learn from other specialists, like that is fantastic. That&#8217;s so amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, it sounds lofty when you put it into words, but the truth is, this is our normal every day, and maybe we&#8217;ve gotten a little used to it. But if you take a step back and look, it&#8217;s amazing what the internet has enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:22] Nathan Wrigley: I occasionally, and it really is an example of how quickly you can become, something that is extraordinary becomes completely normal, and you don&#8217;t really expect what&#8217;s going on. But occasionally I have the thought that, I&#8217;ll be looking at my computer, on my phone, and I think what I&#8217;m doing, to my 10-year-old self, was the realm of Star Trek. It was science fiction that there was a device in somebody&#8217;s hand which enabled you to communicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a screen which held images on it, and it was all encapsulated in your hand, you know? And obviously Star Trek, well, we&#8217;ve still got a long way to go. We can&#8217;t transport each other across the universe and so on. But it&#8217;s incredibly profound. And the mere fact, just take a look and think about it for a moment. You&#8217;re probably listening to this on a phone, dear listener, and I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;ve probably got a pair of Bluetooth headphones or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incredible stack of technology, which is now completely normal. You and I collaborating for this episode on a Google Doc. The world has utterly changed, and it really does behoove everyone, once in a while, to take a step back and think, wow, I&#8217;m really lucky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:31] Aaron D. Campbell: I mean, when I was in school, my teacher very specifically would not let us use calculators on tests because, quote, you will not always have a calculator in your pocket. You need to know how to do this. Well, they were wrong. I have a calculator in my pocket, which is actually also a computer connected to every other computer in the world. It&#8217;s astounding how much things have changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty remarkable. I mean, I guess the next point that I want to raise is that the web, despite the fact that it&#8217;s marvelous in all these ways that we&#8217;ve just described, I think it&#8217;s, well, we&#8217;ve had an era over the last, let&#8217;s say, decade, maybe more, where it feels like the internet has been taken over largely by closed corporate platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, not to throw any aspersions out there, and not to name only these ones, but the ones which come to mind in my life are Google, dominating search, for example. You know, I basically have outsourced my brain most of the time to Google. I don&#8217;t really think I just Google something, and then trust that what Google gives me back is going to be credible and accurate. And I really give it a hundred percent of that. You know, I don&#8217;t question what it gives back. I assume that the algorithm is doing me justice and doing me a favor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And equally things like Facebook over the years, I&#8217;ve invested large amounts of time into that. But it feels like in the last year, so we&#8217;re in 2025, most people have got a slightly different relationship. There&#8217;s maybe a bit more skepticism coming in. We can see the harms that maybe some of these companies are doing. And so this really does feel like a moment where open platforms, WordPress in particular, it&#8217;s an important moment to step up. So really there&#8217;s no question there. It&#8217;s more like, do you have any thoughts about proprietary platforms and their growing dominance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] Aaron D. Campbell: Yeah. First of all, I hope that you are right and that in 2025 we&#8217;re seeing some of that, kind of, questioning of whether these closed, for-profit platforms are really doing what&#8217;s best for us. Because I know that they&#8217;re doing what&#8217;s best for them. The question is whether that is also what&#8217;s best for us. Companies like Facebook, like Google, they&#8217;re looking out for themselves. The question is, does that help us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re right, we&#8217;ve all outsourced our brain to Google in many ways. I mean, when you talk about, I don&#8217;t know, researching a thing, you don&#8217;t even say, I&#8217;m going to go research it. You say, I&#8217;m going to go Google it. That&#8217;s what that means in our vernacular. And I think that, I hope that, people are really starting to realise, not that that&#8217;s bad because I don&#8217;t think it is, I am actually super thankful that Google makes it so easy for me to learn so many things. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I hope that they, everyone&#8217;s starting to understand some of the potential risks there. Is it good that you don&#8217;t even question whether what Google fed back to you is the right thing? Does Google get to decide what we&#8217;re able to learn or not learn now? Is that healthy for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love if people are asking those kinds of questions, because it pushes toward having more alternatives. How do you go check, if you decide that you&#8217;re not sure if Google&#8217;s really looking out for you, how do you go check that? What do you use to make sure that Google&#8217;s still giving you what you ought to get? And if you go looking for that, that&#8217;s good. Going and looking for those alternatives, ensuring that there is a choice keeps us from being locked in, in a way that becomes unhealthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:11] Nathan Wrigley: I think my intuition is that increasingly these platforms seem to be tied up in profit motives, and so, the example that comes to mind in my head is the algorithmic feed in your social network of choice, really. Insert whichever platform you want there. But the idea that it will maximize engagement at any cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if it can keep your eyes glued to the screen for another minute, that&#8217;s a win, regardless of whether or not that information that&#8217;s being given to you is good. And I&#8217;m doing air quotes. And so if that were to creep into, for example, Google search, okay, can we keep you on our platform? I know that&#8217;s a silly example because that&#8217;s not really the point of Google, but you get the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I&#8217;m wondering is, is profit really kind of the enemy here? Does everything have to be freely done by volunteers for it to be open? Because there&#8217;s this feeling, it feels that there&#8217;s a bit of that in the open source community. You know, if it&#8217;s done by volunteers, if it&#8217;s done for free, if you can access it completely for free, if the platform&#8217;s code is verifiable and open on the web, is that better? So, yeah, sorry there&#8217;s a lot there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:18] Aaron D. Campbell: Well, first of all, I&#8217;ll go ahead and plant my flag on this one. And it&#8217;s maybe not the most popular opinion amongst the hardcore open source people that I honestly spend a lot of time with and work with regularly. But I don&#8217;t think profit is bad. I don&#8217;t. But if that is the core motive and that becomes the only tool that you have is one that is focused on profiting off of you, then yeah, there are concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Facebook, you&#8217;re right, or any of these social networks, they want to keep you around as long as they can because that&#8217;s their profit model. However, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t profit off of open, and I am fine with profit as long as there is open. There are many companies in our space that make really good profit implementing WordPress solutions. That is open. The companies that they are implementing those solutions for own their own data. They can move it wherever they want. That&#8217;s great, even if there&#8217;s profit there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I don&#8217;t think that profit alone is the enemy, but it does seem like most of these kind of closed solutions, yeah, are by for profit companies that are just looking to profit. And again, I think it comes down to choice. As long as there are enough options out there, you&#8217;re not beholden to just the one model from the one company. You know, social networks is a good example. If there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s a problem with you and Facebook, you can go to some other social network. There are other options. It&#8217;s when it&#8217;s a for-profit and just one option that it really starts to become a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:03] Nathan Wrigley: I think it&#8217;s really a difficult thread to get right in our community. Because the WordPress community in particular does seem to have two sides. There&#8217;s the real for-profit side, and obviously we&#8217;re here at WordCamp Asia, and if we were to walk into any of the sponsor booths, there&#8217;s a bunch of companies here. And I imagine the fact that they can sponsor, they&#8217;re making a healthy profit. You know, they&#8217;re sending staff here and they&#8217;ve got a booth and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s also the more, and again, I&#8217;m doing air quotes here, there&#8217;s the more community side, which seem to see that as a bit of a trade off. We&#8217;ve got to have these people here, but on some level it would be better if they weren&#8217;t here. If we could just do the whole thing more non-profit, that would be better. So I feel that the community we&#8217;ve got, that&#8217;s a difficult tightrope to tread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:48] Aaron D. Campbell: It&#8217;s a very difficult tightrope to tread. The way that I thread it, I get the altruistic, if we could do everything just volunteer, but we could also have diverse volunteers and many volunteers with different points of view, and different sort of technical backgrounds, right? So that we could build a thing that works for everyone, that would be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s really difficult because you see many open source projects that had that and built up and then failed and have sort of disappeared, because it&#8217;s very difficult to have longevity in that. To have people that stay around long enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that what the for-profit side does in our WordPress space is it helps ensure the longevity because those companies, hosts, for example, are hosting many, many thousands, or tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of WordPress sites, they&#8217;re making money off of that. And so they have a vested interest in making sure that WordPress continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, there&#8217;s this fine balance between, they&#8217;re actually investing in a way that helps keep the platform going, keep the platform being built, keep the platform improving. But does that also mean that they want some influence in the platform? And I think that that&#8217;s that line you have to tread where profit helps with longevity. It does, it keeps people around. But it also leads towards a desire to influence. And are we watching out for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is been a question that the WordPress project has been struggling with since its very beginning. I think that we&#8217;ve got it right at times. I think we&#8217;ve got it wrong at times. But I think that by and large, for 20 plus years, we have successfully brought those two things together, in a way that&#8217;s built something pretty amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:39] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. And also if you think about it in the long march of history, the internet is still in its infancy. And these open source platforms, this idea of volunteering your time for a global project is quite a new thing. We are just figuring it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so whilst you and I are inside the baseball, we hear the arguments from both sides all the time, give it another a hundred years and no doubt things will have bedded down and the arguments would&#8217;ve been done this way and that way, and hopefully things figured out. So to me, it&#8217;s pretty remarkable that we&#8217;ve even got 20 years under our belt. Yeah, there&#8217;s going to be some disagreements along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:15] Aaron D. Campbell: The internet sort of, as we know, it&#8217;s about 34 years old. It&#8217;s not been around long when you take a more, sort of, broader historical view alright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:24] Nathan Wrigley: Over the last period of time, I&#8217;m going to say 12, 15 years, something like that, the internet feels like it&#8217;s become a sort of platform. So a good example of that would be social media, so X, Twitter and all the other ones, LinkedIn, and the multitude of ones that have come in to existence and even gone away in some cases. They&#8217;ve obviously got their proprietary technology stack, but it feels to me what you are proposing is that the internet shouldn&#8217;t be a place of platforms, it should be more a place of protocols. And what I mean by that is the underpinning technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as an example, we could swap out X for something like ActivityPub or the AT Protocol. And then a variety of different platforms can build on top of that, change the UI, change the UX, change the experience for everybody. But we&#8217;d all be able to communicate using that same thing. Have I kind of got that right? Is that what you are hoping for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:14] Aaron D. Campbell: I would love to see more of the platforms on the internet having open standards, open protocols, open data standards at their core. It would be fantastic if something like Twitter, X, whatever it is now, built on top of an open standard. And that was, like they built their own custom experience on top of it. They brought a lot of people together and gave a good experience, but that you could, other companies could also implement that protocol. And again, then you would have choice and options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that at its core, like the easiest way to sum this up for somebody experiencing it is that, I really think that lock-in is unhealthy. If you can just choose to go somewhere else and you&#8217;re not locked in, then that company needs to keep you around by just serving you better, having a better experience for you, delivering more value to you. Rather than keeping you around because you&#8217;re locked in, and you&#8217;ve built a following there and you can&#8217;t get it anywhere else, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yes, I love all these varieties of platforms focusing in on specific things, you know, like LinkedIn on jobs and professional connections. I wish that more of them shared open standards at their core that could be implemented by others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:35] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think there&#8217;s a realistic chance that these companies will move towards these more open protocols? Because obviously, you know, they weren&#8217;t, they weren&#8217;t there at the beginning. They developed their own code base and soon discovered, gosh, there&#8217;s a real economic lever here. If we can keep eyeballs on our platform, if we can lock data inside the platform so that they can&#8217;t go away, you know, users of LinkedIn, it&#8217;s just, you&#8217;re in LinkedIn, you can&#8217;t get stuff out of LinkedIn, it&#8217;s in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any incentive for them to move to an open protocol? Apart from the fact that it&#8217;s just a morally good position to be in. Because it feels like if we were talking to the executives of LinkedIn, Facebook, et cetera, they would maybe make the right noises, but then they turn around and say, huh, we&#8217;re not going anywhere near that. We want to lock people in. We want everybody to be locked inside our silo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:21] Aaron D. Campbell: Unfortunately, I think that there&#8217;s not a lot of, there&#8217;s not a good enough reason yet for them to move that way. So I don&#8217;t see a lot of the current platforms moving that way, at least not in the short term. I hope that some of these new platforms that are spinning up now, and that will in the near future, that might make use of that. We might be able to see new ones coming on with open standards, but I think it&#8217;s less likely to see existing ones move to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I were talking to those executives though, and trying to talk about what the benefits would be to them, I think that the main things that I would try to focus on is, if there&#8217;s a chunk of your code, your system that many people are working on and improving, and you don&#8217;t have to fund every single worker on it, that there can be shared benefit from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about this with WordPress and hosts all the time. Yeah, build some of your own custom cool stuff on top of WordPress, but also help improve WordPress itself. Yes, that improves it, the experience at other hosts as well. But if every host is doing that, then everyone&#8217;s getting shared benefit as WordPress gets better across the board. And so these existing platforms could benefit from that, not having to be the only one working on improving the protocols or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other thing is, if you are really confident that you&#8217;re building something great, if you really think you have a great product, then if you have shared protocols, that means you should be able to bring people in from those other companies that have those shared protocols. Because it means it&#8217;s easier to bring people from other places to you. They all tend to focus on the, saving what we have, preventing people from leaving. But if you really think that you can offer the best, then you can also win people in that way. And that&#8217;s sort of the approach that I take when I talk to them, but it&#8217;s difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:22] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I wonder what the age demographic of these debates is. And what I mean by that is, when it comes to events like WordCamps, if I&#8217;m looking around and being honest, I&#8217;m not really seeing many young people. And I don&#8217;t really know what I mean by young, but it seems like the average age here is not really anywhere near 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I wonder if the ship has sailed in terms of, let&#8217;s take a typical child in the UK, a 16-year-old child, something like that. The excitement is all around things like TikTok and Instagram. I would imagine that the typical 16-year-old doesn&#8217;t even know that there&#8217;s such a thing as an open protocol. It&#8217;s just more, I want to use that service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I wonder if, well, where we need people to be going with these debates is skewing it more towards young people because they&#8217;re going to be the future. Like you and I, we, well, we&#8217;re a bit older, and we probably understand that a little bit more. I don&#8217;t know where the younger people sit around in all of this, and whether or not their semi addiction to technology is something that we can get in the way of. Or if there&#8217;s an argument to be had, if we need to be going out and talking about these things in schools, encouraging it. Curriculums in colleges and what have you, to be talking about this more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:30] Aaron D. Campbell: I think that you&#8217;re right, that it skews towards the older crowd a little bit. As a parent, I kind of draw a parallel here, right? You can tell a kid, don&#8217;t touch that it&#8217;s hot, don&#8217;t touch that it&#8217;s hot, don&#8217;t touch that it&#8217;s hot. But it&#8217;s when they touch that and get burned, hopefully not too badly, but that&#8217;s when they&#8217;re like, oh, it&#8217;s hot. I need to pay attention to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that that&#8217;s the same kind of struggle that I have conveying this kind of thing to youths right now is. Yeah, they&#8217;re super into all these platforms, but what they haven&#8217;t experienced yet is spending a lot of time building a thing on a platform and then it going away, and them having to start all over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people like you and I, people our age, we probably have. We may have experienced that many times over and, sort of, you can tell them what the risks are, but if they haven&#8217;t felt it yet, maybe they don&#8217;t quite get the importance of it. And I wish that there was an easier way to help them learn from my painful experiences rather than make them experience it themselves. But I definitely struggle with figuring out how to properly convey that in a way that they grasp the levity. I do think it&#8217;s important if we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:43] Nathan Wrigley: We shared some show notes when we were arranging this episode, and the question that I think hit you, the question that hit home the most was one that I wrote and it went like this. How do we get open, in quotes, to be the default given the market forces that we&#8217;re working against?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so again, the example of Facebook, Google, et cetera. You know, they&#8217;ve got deep pockets, an incredible amount of money to spend on ads. They can occupy all the app stores, and they&#8217;ve got incredible lobby groups and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you thought, well, I think you thought that that was the question in this interview that was going to be the most interest to you. So how do we get open to be the default given the power of these massive platforms?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:22] Aaron D. Campbell: It&#8217;s so difficult, right? I think that I said that this is the billion dollar question. I think that this is kind of the core of what we need to look at and figure out. And I do think that there are some people in our space, in the open space, but even specifically in WordPress, that are trying to figure this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is amazing in that it&#8217;s put together by volunteers all over the world, and there&#8217;s contributors in every walk of life. But it&#8217;s not coordinated in a way that a company like a Google or a Meta or whatever, it can be coordinated to funnel all of their funds together and invest in, whether it&#8217;s lobbying or advertising or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to bring all this variety of companies, and people in our space together in a coordinated way like that, and that&#8217;s so much more difficult when each one of these companies is their own entity. But you&#8217;re starting to see some groups like the Scale Consortium, some of the enterprise WordPress agencies in our space have formed this consortium to work together to put out this kind of like enterprise level marketing for WordPress at that level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I would love to see more of that kind of thing happening. I think that groups working together is kind of our only chance of trying to compete with some of these companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:50] Nathan Wrigley: What was the organisation called? The Scale Consortium? Yeah, the Scale Consortium. Okay. And do you have a URL for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:56] Aaron D. Campbell: I think it&#8217;s scaleconsortium.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:59] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, I&#8217;ll include that in the show notes. But is this something that you are involved with personally? Does A2 Hosting, or are you involved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:06] Aaron D. Campbell: No. So in my past life, I guess, before I really got into hosting, I ran an agency for many years including working in the enterprise space. And so I&#8217;m just still close to a lot of the other agency folks, agencies that are a part of this or people like Crowd Favorite and Human Made and 10up. They&#8217;re forming this Scale Consortium, and it&#8217;s fantastic. I talk to them about it. Every time I can see them and talk to them I want to talk to them about this thing they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:32] Nathan Wrigley: It is kind of interesting and it&#8217;s fairly unique, I think, open source. The capacity of rivals, and again, I&#8217;m using air quotes. Yes, we can get together because, well, you know, Microsoft Bing getting together with Google, that seems really strange. I mean, maybe there&#8217;s a few web interoperability things that those companies, those proprietary companies get together on. But you know, they&#8217;re commercial rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the WordPress space, that kind of thing&#8217;s possible. And in the open source space, that kind of thing is possible, because it&#8217;s more a case of a rising tide carries all boats. So not a case of, well yeah, we&#8217;ve got to kill the competition, kill the opposition. And that&#8217;s curious. And maybe that is the key to its success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:08] Aaron D. Campbell: I think that you&#8217;re right about the rising tide lifting all ships. I think that in our space, WordPress especially, we have this amazing like coopetition thing where it&#8217;s cooperative competitors working together. And I think that that&#8217;s because, as long as we grow the open web, as long as we grow the people, the companies, the websites that are building on top of these open platforms, literally the pie is growing. So you don&#8217;t have to take away somebody else&#8217;s slice of the pie. As the pie grows, you can just have more and more and more of the pie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that companies in our space have really realised that. The more that they can get these enterprise level customers be building on us instead of Adobe&#8217;s platform, the more the pie has grown, and their piece of it grows. And so if they all work together, they can grow the pie better. And I think that that&#8217;s, honestly, that just makes it a more friendly, more fun area of the internet to work in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:10] Nathan Wrigley: Do you think WordPress encapsulates a more or less perfect example of the open web? I mean, obviously we&#8217;ve got our own problems, but generally speaking, would you hold up WordPress as a really fine example of the open web or would you say there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, room for improvement?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:25] Aaron D. Campbell: I think that there&#8217;s always room for improvement. I would hold up WordPress as a pillar of paving the way, right? Like, we&#8217;ve gotten it wrong a number of times, but we have pushed so hard toward building this open platform that really is truly open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there are single points of failure and stuff, even in how we have things set up. But by and large, I think we&#8217;ve done it right. I&#8217;m not going to say we&#8217;re perfect. That would be silly, because I think that we should continue to push to grow and improve. And if you think you&#8217;re perfect, you&#8217;re not motivated to do that. But, yeah, I think that we&#8217;ve done a really good job in WordPress of focusing on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:05] Nathan Wrigley: Well, hopefully people listening to this podcast, by the time this comes out, maybe Aaron&#8217;s talk will be out on WordPress TV. We&#8217;ll have to see. It&#8217;s a really interesting subject. It speaks to so many of the reasons why I enjoy the internet, and why I&#8217;ve skewed towards open source as opposed to proprietary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s just something profoundly meaningful there for me. And let&#8217;s hope that if we would have this conversation in, oh, I don&#8217;t know, 10 years time or something like that, the arguments that you are portraying here, the powerful reasons for going open and not closed, let&#8217;s hope they win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:36] Aaron D. Campbell: Let&#8217;s. That&#8217;s one of the most exciting things I could imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:39] Nathan Wrigley: Well, Aaron, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:44] Aaron D. Campbell: Thank you for having me. This was fantastic.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell/\">Aaron D. Campbell</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron is an international speaker, open source advocate, and self-described outgoing introvert. He’s been a regular contributor to WordPress for more than a decade, and is currently Director of Product at <a href=\"https://www.a2hosting.com/\">A2 Hosting</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His long-standing enthusiasm for WordPress stems from its role as a necessary counterbalance to closed web solutions, providing a vital open-source alternative that fosters accountability among digital platforms. Aaron&#8217;s vision of WordPress&#8217;s importance has fuelled his sustained commitment and excitement for the platform, matching his initial zeal from years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we talk about a topic that&#8217;s integral to Aaron, and likely resonates with many of you listeners, the importance of the open web. With the advent of closed platforms, open standards, and open source have become more crucial than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron shares his journey in the WordPress space, and how his commitment to the open web has kept him passionate about it over the years. We discuss the evolution of open web concepts, maintaining interoperability, and ensuring your digital creations remain under your control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We compare this with the growing dominance of closed corporate platforms, and examine the impact of profit motives, versus the more altruistic goals of open source. Aaron articulates why preserving the openness of the web is essential, not just for innovation but for the entire fabric of global society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the role of open systems and the future they shape, and why the open web matters now more than ever, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron&#8217;s presentation at WordCamp Asia 2025 &#8211; <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/session/tbd-6/\">The Future: Why the Open Web Matters</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.a2hosting.com/\">A2 Hosting</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\">ActivityPub</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/overview\">AT Protocol</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scaleconsortium.org/\">Scale Consortium</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Do The Woo Community: Do the Woo is Proudly Sponsoring WordCamp Lisboa 2025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://dothewoo.io/?post_type=blog&p=94622\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/do-the-woo-is-proudly-sponsoring-wordcamp-lisboa-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:186:\"We are excited to sponsor WordCamp Lisboa on May 16th and 17th, following a Warmup Meetup.
